# Changelog

All notable changes to Halo Harness (continuing `rolo-claude`, renamed at
version 2.0.0) are recorded here, newest first. Every entry older than the
rename keeps the `rolo-claude`/`rolo_claude` names it was written under --
history, not rewritten. This project does not (yet) follow strict semver
across the 0.3.x line -- each 0.3.0 milestone below was a working
checkpoint toward the single 0.3.0 release, not a separate published
version.

## [2.0.7] - unreleased

### Round 0b: background notices stop impersonating the user

rolo's live report (2026-10-08): with a background job or sub-agent
finishing between turns, the completion notice was delivered as a
USER-role message merged into the next turn -- the model read a status
blob interleaved with the owner's actual question and answered the
status first ("typing a question, getting a blob back of what's been
done, then an answer is not a good flow"). Pending notices are now
delivered as clearly-marked SYSTEM-FRAMED status blocks: a
`status_notice` snapshot logged AFTER the human's own message (the
derived request folds it into the same user turn, behind their words),
wrapped in a frame that says the block is automated harness status,
NOT a message from the human, and to answer the human first. The event
stream carries a new `status_notice` event (plain text + framed copy):
the TUI renders it as an italic status note instead of a user bubble,
`cc:`/`cx:` turns collect the framed copy as child context, and print
mode ignores it exactly as it ignored the old delivery (its surface
was always the toast, unchanged). A single notice still carries its
full text verbatim; 2+ still collapse into one compact block
(2.0.2 round C, unchanged); `/stats` never counted these and still
does not. Pinned by `tests/test_round_0b_status_notices.py`.

### Round 0c: steers reach running work (through tool calls)

rolo's live report (2026-10-08): a steer typed while a sub-agent or a
long Bash command ran waited for it to finish -- 60s+ of the words
sitting invisible to the work. Steers now cut THROUGH running calls:

- **A foreground Bash command is moved to the background, not killed.**
  A per-session steer-cut watcher fires the moment a steer queues while
  a tool runs; Bash hands its still-live process to the job registry
  (the same adopt-from-timeout plumbing) and returns "cut short by the
  user's new message -- moved to the background as shell_id X". The
  turn reaches its steer safe point immediately, the command keeps
  running, and its output lands later as a round-0b status notice. A
  real Esc/interrupt still kills the process group exactly as before
  (abort always wins the race); PowerShell and every other tool keep
  the pre-0c "running tools finish" contract.
- **A foreground sub-agent gets the steer forwarded into itself.** The
  agent-batch drain loop polls for pending steers and forwards each
  into every live child of the batch (`child.steer(text)`), so the
  child applies the words at ITS next safe point -- its own Bash gets
  the same cut treatment, recursively. A forwarded steer is consumed
  by the child (the parent never re-applies it); if no child can take
  it, it stays on the parent queue exactly as before.
- **Nothing is ever lost.** A forwarded steer the child never got to
  apply (its turn ended between the forward and its next safe point)
  is handed back to the parent when the child finishes, and applies at
  the parent's next safe point. Pinned by
  `tests/test_round_0c_steer_through.py` (run_streamed handoff/abort
  race, Bash adoption, forwarding consume/fallback, the on_child hook,
  and a full parent-child e2e with a mid-Bash steer).

### Cyber Pillar 1: filter-aware routing (1.1-1.3)

A provider content filter is not an answer. `finish_reason:
"content_filter"` (generic chat dialect), GLM's `finish_reason:
"sensitive"`, and a native Anthropic `stop_reason: "refusal"` are now
recognized on every harness-driven response, and a filtered reply is
NEVER persisted as an assistant turn. Each live filter signal is
recorded in a measured per-machine census (`<state_dir>/filter-
census.json`, keyed by raw model ref, built purely from real traffic --
nothing is ever probed), and the request is transparently rerouted to
the next fallback lane (a DIFFERENT model -- re-running against the
same one would just repeat), with a notification naming what was
filtered and where the request went. With no lane configured, the old
GLM contract stands: a clear, never-retried error carrying whatever
text did stream. Pinned by `tests/test_round_1_filter_routing.py`
(census record/rank/corruption, reroute + never-persist, sensitive
reroute, no-lane terminal error, both-lanes-filtered exhaustion).

### Cyber Pillar 2: verify-everything preflight + continuous canaries

`halo preflight [--lanes A,B] [--json] [--skip-local] [--no-vision]
[--timeout S]` is the exit-code-gated gate a long autonomous run is
worth starting under. Local tools are verified BY EFFECT -- the bytes
really land on disk, the grep really matches; a tool that reports
success without the effect fails the gate. Each provider lane gets one
measured canary: a real completion, one tool call the lane must emit
and the probe must actually run (a lane whose replies never carry tool
calls fails -- datasheets lie, measurements don't), an image the lane
must accept when its profile claims vision (catches lying vision
flags), and a truncation check comparing the usage echo against what
was sent. Every result lands in the canary census
(`<state_dir>/canary-census.json`). During long runs, a continuous
canary rides every model call with zero extra requests: a one-time
warning when a usage echo accounts for under half of what was sent
(silent context truncation), and a periodic health note (calls,
filtered, failures, spend, context fill) every 25 calls or 10 minutes,
env-tunable. Pinned by `tests/test_round_2_preflight.py` (effect
verification incl. a sabotaged tool, full-pass/no-tools/truncation/
vision lane canaries, CLI exit codes + the green path end to end, and
the continuous canary's truncation warning + periodic note).

### Round 0e: the concierge (secretary + eyes) + one media agent

One secretary that is also the eyes, one media agent -- not three (rolo,
2026-10-08). The concierge is a ROLE (`roles.concierge`, measured lane:
`or:z-ai/glm-5.3-flash`, vision=True at $0.50/M out vs the main
glm-5.3's $7.00/M and blind). Three surfaces, each degrading to the
pre-0e behavior when the role is unset:

- **`/ask <question>`** -- quick Q&A and "what's been done" answered
  WITHOUT waking the orchestrator: a one-shot call over a deterministic
  digest of the recent session history, never through the session log.
- **The eyes** -- images arriving on a blind active model (the main
  glm-5.3 cannot see the screenshots the 0d fix pastes) are DESCRIBED by
  the concierge and the descriptions fold into the turn as a
  `concierge_vision` snapshot: the blind model still gets real image
  understanding. No concierge -> the old path-mention behavior.
- **The notice digest** -- a pending status block (round 0b) is
  digested to a couple of lines for the model (frame + digest +
  pointer), with the verbatim block archived in a meta node, never
  model-visible; `/tasks`, resume and export still see everything.

The ONE media agent (`templates/agents/media.yaml`) rides a new
deterministic `Media` tool: local ffmpeg/ffprobe extraction of evenly
spaced frames + metadata (zero tokens -- ingestion is tooling, not model
work), with understanding left to the vision-capable lane the bio
prefers. Pinned by `tests/test_round_0e_concierge_media.py` (role
resolution, `/ask` log-isolation, eyes on/off, digest + archive, real
ffmpeg frame extraction, bio sanity).

### Local embeddings + /recall + the generic `local:` route (the old 2.0.6 scope)

Semantic search over auto-memory topics and past sessions on a LOCAL
embedding model: `halo recall <query> [--k N] [--no-refresh]
[--build-only]` and `/recall <query>` in the TUI. Two transports, one
config (`embeddings` in `~/.halo/config.json`): Ollama's native
`/api/embed` on the default or named host, or any OpenAI-compatible
`/v1/embeddings` server (`base_url`/`api_key`) -- LM Studio, llama.cpp
server, vLLM, a managed server. The index (`~/.halo/index/
embeddings.jsonl`) refreshes incrementally (mtime-keyed: unchanged
files are never re-embedded; vanished sources are pruned); sessions are
indexed by title/first-prompt/last-answer, memory topics by their full
text; results rank by cosine similarity with scores, kinds and paths.
DISABLED until `embeddings.model` is set -- nothing probes, nothing
costs, until the owner asks. The generic `local:` chat route lands with
it: `local:<model>` or `local:<model>@<name>` against a `local.servers`
config entry (LM Studio, llama.cpp server, vLLM), plain openai-chat
dialect with per-server `context` discovery. Pinned by
`tests/test_round_embeddings_local.py` (disabled-until-configured, both
transports against a real local HTTP server, index build/incremental/
prune, ranking, CLI exit codes, `local:` parsing/creds/context, and a
real session turn through the route).

## [2.0.6.1] - 2026-10-08

Hotfix release: two owner-live TUI fixes from the 2.0.6 release
session, shipped the same way 2.0.3.1 shipped clipboard images.

### Ctrl+Alt+V: pasting an image when the terminal eats Ctrl+V

rolo's live report (2026-10-08): pasting a freshly-taken screenshot did
nothing. The 2.0.3.1 clipboard-image path was fine -- the keypress
never reached halo: on Windows Terminal (and most modern terminals)
Ctrl+V is intercepted by the TERMINAL, which runs its own paste, finds
no text on an image-only clipboard, and does nothing. Ctrl+Alt+V is
not a terminal default anywhere and always reaches the app; the
existing paste worker already reads text-first-then-image, so the one
key covers both payloads. (Shift+Insert, the other 2.0.3.1 paste key,
was also missing from the tips-validation key set -- added.)

### Steering text now renders the instant you hit Enter

rolo's live report (2026-10-07 night): a steer typed mid-turn showed
only "↳ steering…" while the actual words sat invisible for over a
minute ("it just said thinking for a long ass time"). Root cause: the
steer's text only rendered as a user bubble at APPLY time ("moments
later"), but a turn parked inside a long tool call (a sub-agent over
OpenRouter, a long Bash) can go minutes between steer safe points. The
text now renders immediately as a real user bubble at submit; the
apply-time duplicate is suppressed (deduped by text against the
pending-steer list; a genuinely identical LATER message still renders).

## [2.0.6] - 2026-10-07

### The transcript code-block hover bug (release-gate fix)

Code blocks in the transcript turned into black boxes that vanished
when the mouse passed over them (worst with local models, which wrap
most answers in fences). Root cause: Textual's MarkdownFence is itself
a scrollable container -- on mouse entry Textual repaints the region
as a scroll target, and that repaint races the ongoing stream updates.
Fences inside a transcript never need to scroll (the transcript itself
scrolls), so they are pinned to non-scrolling now and the hover repaint
path disappears entirely.

### "Try it" and the lineup smoke run, cost shown first (round 14)

The bio editor gains a "Try it (cost first)" button and the lineup
editor a "Smoke run (cost first)" button: the estimated cost of every
distinct model the lineup resolves to prints BEFORE a single token is
spent -- real catalog prices times the smoke prompt's token footprint
(`~$0.0011 (600 in / 300 out at $0.6/$2.4 per 1M)`), `price not in the
catalog -- cost unknown` when a model has no prices, never a fake
$0.00. The call itself rides the proven print-mode subprocess path
(the bio's own acceptance prompt when it has one), on a worker thread;
the verdict lands beside the cost line. The deferred item from 2.0.5
round 2's list, closed.

### Lineup export/import bundles (round 13)

`halo teams export <name> --bundle <dir>` writes the whole lineup as
one portable folder -- the full team template plus every non-shipped
bio it references (shipped-template bios are skipped: every install
already has them) and a `bundle.json` manifest. `halo teams import
<dir>` applies it on any other box: bios land in USER scope, the team
goes through the same validated save path `halo teams import` uses,
and a bio that already exists is never silently overwritten (`--force`
is the explicit opt-in). One command instead of the manual scp.

Also this round: the test-runner SystemExit fix (a test tripping
argparse's `parser.error()` or a stray `sys.exit()` used to escape
`except Exception` and kill the ENTIRE suite run -- it is a failed
test now and the run continues, at both the import and the per-test
layers; KeyboardInterrupt still aborts) and the last order-sensitive
TUI flake (the bare-/effort card test) made deterministic with bounded
polls.

### Carried fix-pass minors, batch B, part 2 (round 12)

The last two: the local-server auto-detect probe gains a 60 s TTL cache
keyed on the port list (a picker paint on a warm process probes
nothing; an explicit refresh forces through) -- the C-11 nuance; and
`fits_beside_main` (the VRAM-aware role redirect) gains the same 60 s
TTL keyed on `(host, main, candidate)` with `None` never cached, so
every role resolution no longer re-pays a `/api/ps` fetch plus a GPU
read -- the C-13 nuance.

### Carried fix-pass minors, batch B, part 1 (round 12)

Text-mode print output carries the provider's own error sentence as the
result text (a script consuming `halo -p`'s stdout sees WHY the run
died, not an empty stream -- JSON mode already did); the cc-session
steer test's race is made deterministic (gated on the first tool RESULT
arriving, not `_cc_state` appearing -- the steer now provably lands
between tool calls 1 and 2); and the Linux chmod-0600 wizard-save
verify passed on the VM (both the env file and config.json are 0600
after saves).

### Carried fix-pass minors, batch A (round 12)

Seven small ones from the 2.0.3 fix-pass notes: `halo config set`'s echo
masks secret-shaped values exactly like the readers (a recorded terminal
never sees the secret twice; the stored value is untouched);
`config list`/`get` show `*_env` REFERENCE names (a variable name is not
a secret) while actual secrets stay masked; `pick_proxy` answers a
plain-HTTP target with `HTTP_PROXY` first (it used to answer
`HTTPS_PROXY` -- backwards for split setups); a plain-HTTP request
through a proxy carries the ABSOLUTE request-target form (`GET
http://host:port/path`, not `/path` -- a proxy cannot know the origin
from a relative line), with the Host header naming the target; the
optional ssh GPU read, `halo models --cc --refresh`, and the Databricks
catalog auto-refresh thread all run the offline gate every other
network path runs (offline, the cc refresh returns the last cached
catalog instead of an empty one); and the wizard's Hugging Face tab
merges into the default local server's existing fields on re-save
instead of replacing them (the same fix the Ollama tab got).

### Gym cloud-model ranking (round 11)

`halo gym propose --candidates local|cloud|all`: the proposal's ranking
pool was local-only by construction, even though the gym already runs
against any reachable model (`halo gym --model or:...`). "cloud" ranks
the `or:`/`dbx:`/`xp:`/endpoint refs only; "all" ranks both pools
together; the default stays "local" -- byte-for-byte the old behavior.
The tokens-per-second term normalizes within the CHOSEN pool, so a
cloud model's throughput is never measured against a local GPU's
ceiling (or vice versa).

### MCP connects off the TUI startup path (round 10)

The TUI paints with its full frozen tool catalog immediately: MCP
connects moved behind the paint. `build_manager(start=False)` (now what
an interactive launch passes) seeds every server's catalog from the
tools cache -- eager and lazy alike, zero connections -- and flags the
manager deferred; the app's own background worker
(`Manager.complete_deferred_start`) then connects pending and
cache-seeded eager servers off the UI thread, posting one transcript
line when anything lands. First-ever runs (no cache yet) connect in
that worker instead of blocking the first paint; lazy servers keep
their first-use contract; print mode (`-p`) keeps the blocking start --
a one-shot wants its tools ready.

### The soak harness (round 9)

`tools/soak.py`: a headless Textual pilot run for a configurable
duration against the mock upstream, injecting idle gaps, a monotonic
clock jump, terminal resizes, a connection reset mid-stream, a
connect-phase drop, a 429 with retry-after, a permission card left
unanswered then answered, a steer during a silent call, and `/compact`
-- after every event a prompt must get a response within a deadline,
the drain tick count must rise monotonically, no traceback may reach
the log, RSS growth stays bounded, and the status cluster must return
to idle. **It caught its first real bug on its first run**: the
Governor's telemetry event (`governor`) was emitted by round 4 and
handled by the TUI, but never registered as a valid event kind -- the
first real TUI session where the Governor paced a 429 crashed the turn
(every earlier test ran headless, where the forwarding is skipped).
The real-machine half (tmux detach/reattach, a 30-minute idle) is the
runbook's, in `docs/harness/LIVE-CHECKS.md`.

### Signed releases (round 8)

Every release now ships a checksummed artifact: the tag's own source
archive (`git archive` of the tag -- the tree and nothing else, no
working-tree dirt possible) plus a `checksums.txt` (the sha256sum
layout), both attached to the GitHub release. And `halo update`
verifies before installing: an update to a TAG checks the target
release carries that checksums asset and refuses one that verifiably
does not (a broken or foreign release); `--no-verify` skips the check,
an unreadable release (offline, rate-limited) fails open with a
warning -- a network blip never blocks an explicitly requested update.

### `halo doctor --roles` (round 7)

The roles lineup's hygiene, headless (the v2.0.4 review's item 6): a
missing `main`, a judge in the same model family as the coder
(self-preference bias -- the family is a coarse first-digit bucket:
glm/qwen/deepseek/...), and unreachable gateway endpoints (one
reachability probe per distinct gateway, no model calls). Exit 1 with
one plain sentence per problem, `--json` for the machine-readable
list; clean lineups print `RESULT: clean`.

### Turn checkpoints, `/rewind turn <N>` (round 6)

Shadow steps now carry the TURN their tool_result event belonged to,
and the store groups them into turn checkpoints: `/rewind turn <N>`
restores the working tree to the START of that turn -- the last step
of the previous turn when one exists (created-by-later-steps files
deleted, exactly like a step rewind), or the session's own start
otherwise (every file any step created is deleted, nothing restored).
`/rewind turn` with no number lists the turns that have checkpoints.
One key rolls back a whole bad agent run's edits; the per-step
`/rewind`/`/undo`/`/redo` flow is unchanged, and pre-round-6 logs
(steps without turn info) simply never group.

### Parallel read-only tool calls: the Bash half (round 5)

The concurrent read-only batch (Read/Grep/Glob, the H3 pool) now admits
a Bash call whose command PROVABLY only reads: a single plain command
from a whitelist (cat, ls, head, tail, grep, rg, find, wc, stat, du,
which, echo, git status/log/diff/show/branch/...), zero shell
metacharacters -- any pipe, redirect, chain, substitution, glob or
history expansion disqualifies the WHOLE command -- after stripping
leading VAR=VALUE assignments and path/.exe suffixes. The classifier is
deliberately dumb (whitelist-only, no cleverness to fool); everything
else runs sequentially exactly as before, and writes never join the
batch.

### Session replay for model swaps (round 4)

`halo replay <session-id> --model <ref> [--turn N] [--json]`: fork the
recorded session (the original file is never appended to), truncate the
fork to just before turn N's user prompt, and re-send that turn's own
prompt against the swapped model through plain print mode -- same cwd,
tools and hooks as any `halo -p`. The side-by-side report names both
outcomes (chars, tokens, cost, tools used) and SAME / DIFFERENT with
the first diverging line, turning "did swapping the researcher help?"
into a diff over real task history (the gym stays for synthetic
batteries; this is your own sessions).

### Acceptance-gated sub-agent returns (round 3)

A sub-agent's hand-back is checked against its bio's own `acceptance`
criteria now (the same `expect` wording the teams doctor and the
pipeline gates use). A failure gets ONE retry -- the critique as a
second user turn on the SAME child session, so it corrects itself with
its own context intact (the bio's `critique:` overrides the default
wording). A second failure escalates with the failure MARKED: the
hand-back carries the note, the cost rollup counts the task failed
(round 2's cost-per-accepted), and the task meta records the verdict.
A run that errored never retries on acceptance; a bio with no
acceptance block is the byte-for-byte old path. Team members' criteria
come from the team's own bio for the role.

### Per-role cost attribution (round 2)

Every cost entry names the role that spent it: the session's own model
calls tag their role ("main" for a root session, the bio's role for a
child), and a sub-agent's rolled-up total carries the role, the bio
(agent name) and `ok` -- the Agent call's own outcome. `/stats` and
`halo stats --roles` now answer "who spent what" with task counts
(one rollup node = one Agent-call completion), accepted/total, cost per
task and cost per accepted result, so a role assignment can be judged
by evidence. The main session's own spend appears as its own row for
the first time (it was invisible to `--roles` before); a `cc:` estimate
keeps landing in the subscription lane, never counted as real spend.

## [2.0.5] - 2026-10-07

### Team control (round 5)

The lineup sections are ENFORCED by the live agent loop now (the roadmap's
own "Deferred to 2.0.5 with the Governor" call coming due). A session
running under a team (`team:` in config.json or the new `--team <name>`
flag, which also overlays the team's own resolved role table without
touching config) holds one `teams_runtime.TeamControl` for its whole tree:

- **routing** -- the first routing key (or a member's `use_for` word) in a
  call's description/prompt picks the role/alias at spawn time; the
  template's `default` applies otherwise; an explicit `Agent(role=...)`
  always wins.
- **delegation** -- `max_depth` caps depth, `max_parallel` sizes the
  session's in-flight spawn gate, `handoff` shapes the hand-back
  (summary/full/structured), `forward_text` prepends the parent's latest
  user text.
- **budget** -- `max_budget_usd`/`max_total_turns`/`max_wall_time` (a
  number of seconds or a duration like `3h`) count the whole tree; when
  exhausted the team stops delegating and says so in one line.
  `agents_may_exceed: true` keeps members running while still counting.
- **escalation** -- `triggers` (`tool_failures`, `context_overflow`,
  `budget_exhausted`) switch the session to `to`; `ask: true` shows the
  existing approval card first, `ask: false` switches and announces.
- **context**/**permissions** -- team files/skills load for every member;
  `memory.namespace` is a shared memory dir only `writers` may write;
  mode/rules/offline apply to every member on top of the bio's own.
- **org** -- each member's completion is a one-line report addressed to
  its `reports_to`, delivered as a user-role notice on the root session.
- **pipeline** -- stages run in order; a `required` gate must pass its
  stage's acceptance before the next stage's calls run, an `optional` one
  records and continues.

Agent bios gain `hooks` (`pre_tool`/`post_tool`/`on_start`/`on_finish`,
Claude Code's own hook shape run by the existing hook runner with
`HALO_AGENT` set; a template assignment may override them per key),
`schedule` (`cron`/`every` + prompt, firing the agent as a background job
while a session that loaded the team is alive -- never a system service)
and `triggers` (`on: file_change`/`event`/`message`, one shot per
session). New: `halo agents schedule list|run|pause|resume|rm`, the
`/agents schedule` slash command, `halo doctor --teams [NAME]` (exercises
the first required gate), `/teams show <name>`, and the per-section
enforcement block in `halo teams show`. The loaders validate all the new
sections with one plain line per problem. See docs/AGENTS.md.

### Governor

- **Cross-process adaptive rate limiting per gateway host** (round 4,
  ported from the owner's kit with the review changes applied): one
  shared token bucket + hard in-flight cap per gateway HOST, state on
  disk under `~/.halo/governor/` behind cross-platform file locks
  (flock/msvcrt) with a lock timeout, AIMD (an overload status cuts the
  rate and sets a cooldown honouring `Retry-After` in both its forms,
  capped; sustained success ramps back), priority fairness (main/
  orchestrator 0, judge/reviewer/verifier/tester/planner 1, others 2;
  `governor.priorities` overrides, an agent bio's `limits.priority`
  wins), dead-pid reaping, and a single half-open probe as the only
  fail-open. `providers/governor.py` + `providers/governor_state.py`.
- **One choke point**: every remote model request (`dbx:` `or:` `ant:`
  `oai:` `hf:` `xp:` `ol:`) goes through `governed_upstream()` in
  `providers/http.py` carrying the session's role, agent id, session id
  and model; the Governor owns the 429/overload retry ladder for
  governed routes and the agent loop's own ladder steps aside for those
  (still retrying everything else). `cc:`/`cx:` drive a CLI child, not
  HTTP: not governed. Two caller-side timeouts in a row count as
  overload; transport errors release neutrally; a plain 500 is neutral
  unless the body says overloaded.
- **Failover** (`providers/gateway_routing.py`): fallback candidates
  (the model, `--fallback-model`, then the new `roles.<name>.fallbacks`)
  are ordered by gateway health -- circuit-open hosts skipped,
  least-cooled wins when all are open -- and the switch notice names
  the health that caused it. `halo roles` warns when a fallback shares
  the primary's host (the gateway throttles per machine).
- **Lanes**: models carry a tier, `roles.lanes` maps roles to the
  weakest tier they may use, and the standing rule (reviewer/judge/
  tester never weaker than coder) is enforced by the roles validator
  and the team-template loader.
- **Surfaces**: `/gov` and `halo gov [host]` print every bucket and one
  host's recent calls; the status bar shows `gov 4.0 rps / cooldown
  12 s` while a bucket is below its ceiling; `halo doctor` shows each
  gateway's health; a `governor_state_unpersisted` event lands in the
  transcript when state stops persisting. New doc: `docs/GOVERNOR.md`.
  The suite runs with the Governor off by default
  (`HALO_GOVERNOR=0` from the shared test env); governor tests turn it
  on explicitly.

### cc: route v2

- **The stream-json control channel** (`agent/cc_control.py`, new):
  `control_request`/`control_response` wire shapes live-verified against
  the installed claude 2.1.291 (`docs/harness/CC-CONTROL-CHANNEL.md` has
  the full research, including the exact probes run and what they found).
  Detected once per process from `system.init`'s own `capabilities` list,
  cached on the route.
- **Steer cuts cleanly instead of queuing.** A mid-turn steer now sends
  `control_request` `interrupt` and waits for its own `control_response`
  before sending the steer text as the next message -- the same cut-then-
  continue shape every other route's own steer already has. v1's "queued
  for Claude Code" behaviour is kept only as the fallback for an installed
  version old enough to lack the channel. A real, independently-useful
  fix landed alongside this: `turn_is_error` now always reflects the MOST
  RECENT result in a multi-result turn, never an accumulate-and-stick flag
  that could poison a later, successful result with an earlier one's
  error state.
- **Model changes without a restart.** A `cc:`->`cc:` model change tries a
  live `set_model` control request first -- the SAME subprocess and
  conversation kept exactly as they were -- before falling back to the
  existing close-and-`--resume` restart path on anything older or
  unsupported. `set_permission_mode` is implemented and conformance-
  tested but intentionally never wired to a live behaviour change (it
  would re-enable Claude Code's own permission gating, which this route's
  bridge design deliberately keeps out of the loop).
- **`/compact` forwards to Claude Code for real.** Answered locally by
  the child (no model call needed when there isn't enough to summarize),
  surfaced on halo's transcript the same way a native route's own
  compaction is, with Claude Code's own summary when it provides one.
  Halo's own session log is never rewritten by this.
- **Cost line: subscription turns, never spend.** A `cc:` turn now
  accumulates into `CostMeter.subscription_turns`/`subscription_cost_usd`
  instead of `total_usd` -- shown as its own line/segment in `/cost`,
  `/stats`, `halo stats`, and the status bar, explicitly labelled an
  estimate, never counted toward `--max-budget-usd`.
- **Researched, not shipped**: resuming a halo-native transcript as a
  `cc:` child's OWN history (`--resume` against a transcript halo wrote)
  would require halo to write one of Claude Code's own session files,
  which this project's hard rules forbid -- the capped plain-text summary
  this route has always used is kept, documented, unchanged.
- Tests: `tests/helpers/fake_claude_cc.py` gained the control channel
  behind `FAKE_CLAUDE_CC_CONTROL` (default off -- every pre-existing cc:
  test is unaffected); `tests/test_cc_session.py` gained conformance
  coverage for every control message shape (request/response, unsupported
  subtype, malformed response, child exit mid-request) plus the steer,
  set_model, compaction, and cost-line behaviour above.

### Wizard: agent bios and lineups

- **An Agents step** joins the wizard right after the keys step's own
  model enumeration and before Roles (`"agents"` in `init_wizard.
  ALL_STEP_KEYS`; `halo init --step agents` reaches it directly) --
  list every bio (project/user/shipped), New, New from... (inherits
  from any existing bio with a per-field override toggle: only the
  overridden keys are written to the child file), Edit, Duplicate (a
  shipped bio copied into user scope under the same name), Delete, and
  Import (every `.claude/agents/*.md` file not already a bio, one
  result line each). The bio form (`tui/dialogs/agent_bio_editor.py`,
  new) is one screen over every `agents_yaml.BIO_SECTIONS` field, a
  live YAML preview on the right, and every validation problem shown
  beside the field it names as you type, not only on Save.
- **Two sources for a role slot.** The model picker used by the roles
  editor, the org editor, and the new lineup editor gains a source
  switch (`ctrl+a`): Models (unchanged) or Agents (every bio, with its
  description, preferred model, and a tools summary) -- picking a bio
  records it on the slot alongside the resolved model; "New bio..."
  opens the bio form and is treated as picking the bio it saves.
- **A lineup editor** (`tui/dialogs/lineup_editor.py`, new) replaces
  the Roles step's legacy-template-only editing with a Lineup pane
  shown first (the original role-template editor moves to its own
  "Legacy roles" pane, never removed -- a config with no lineup at all
  still needs it): the assignments grid shows the RESOLVED TRUTH per
  row (agent, preferred model, fallback, price, context, tools count,
  a gym score when one exists) with inline warnings needing no
  Governor (a missing bio, no reachable model, a fallback on the same
  gateway as the preference, a duplicate alias, not-exactly-one
  `role: main`); every other `teams_yaml` section is a collapsed
  one-line-summarized YAML block; a free-text "How the pieces work
  together" field saves as the lineup's own `about:` (drafted on
  request, never blank, marked stale after a further change) and
  reaches an active member's system context under that same heading
  (`teams_yaml.member_system_context_addition`, a new pure function
  this round builds and unit-tests -- wiring it into the live agent
  loop is Governor-round work). Save offers to activate the lineup
  (`teams_yaml.apply_team_template`, writing both `roles.*` and
  `team:` in one step).
- **The same forms outside the wizard**: `/agents`/`/teams` in a
  running session open the same list/form screens (list, new, edit,
  duplicate/delete, activate); `halo agents|teams new|edit --form`
  open them from the CLI (`halo teams edit` is new this round,
  symmetrical with `halo agents edit`). One form module each serves
  the wizard, the slash dialogs, and `--form`.
- Tests: `tests/test_wizard_agents_bios.py`, `tests/test_wizard_
  lineup.py`, `tests/test_agents_teams_forms.py` (new, hermetic
  Textual pilots with a fixture catalog, no network, no real model).
- Docs: `docs/AGENTS.md` (the Agents step, the editor's sections,
  `about`), `docs/ROLES.md`/`docs/ORGS.md` (two sources for a slot),
  `docs/HANDBOOK.md`'s wizard walkthrough, `docs/COMMANDS.md` (`--step`,
  new `halo agents`/`halo teams` sections), `docs/SLASH-COMMANDS.md`
  (`/agents`/`/teams`).

### Wizard and roles fixes (round 2b)

- **Roles on/off is one switch, everywhere**: `halo roles on|off`,
  `/roles on|off`, and a "Roles: on / off" toggle at the TOP of the
  wizard's "Roles and lineup" step (off now hides BOTH panes, not just
  the legacy one, and shows one sentence instead); `halo roles` prints
  the state as its first line; `halo roles template load <name>` now
  also turns roles on (it used to leave the table sitting inert).
- **The `standard` lineup** (`templates/teams/standard.yaml`) assigns
  every role to the shipped `default-model` bio, whose `models.
  preference: default` resolves, live, to the session's own current
  default model (`agents_yaml.resolve_agent_bio`'s own new substitution)
  -- "Roles: off" is exactly this, made explicit and inspectable.
- **Bio editor layout**: both panes are a fixed-height scroll region and
  every field is Textual's own `compact` style, so name/description/
  kind/the model fields are visible on open at 80x24 with no scrolling;
  the preferred/fallback field shares one row with its own "Pick..."
  button.
- **Bio editor model picking, root cause**: Ctrl+P/Ctrl+F opened nothing
  because Textual's App always claims `ctrl+p` for its own command
  palette as a priority binding, ahead of any Screen's own binding on
  the same key -- the picker's models were never the problem. Fixed by
  borrowing `app.action_command_palette` for as long as the bio editor
  (and the lineup/org editors, which had the identical collision) is on
  top of the stack.
- **Bug sweep**: Enter on a highlighted bio/lineup/template row opens or
  applies it everywhere (the buttons stay, but are no longer the only
  path); every touched screen focuses its own list/first field on open,
  never a button; the Roles step's Lineup pane applies the highlighted
  lineup on a plain Next, with a check mark on the row Next would apply.
- **Packaging**: `scripts/release.py` rewrites the README's own version
  badge (alt text and badge URL) to the released version and publishes
  a GitHub release for the tag (`gh` CLI, else `curl` with a `git
  credential fill` token -- both only ever through the script's own
  injectable run function); `--no-github-release` skips it. README's
  badge fixed to 2.0.4 (was stuck at 2.0.1).

### Wizard interaction model (round 2c)

`docs/WIZARD.md` (new) names the ten rules every wizard screen now
follows; linked from `docs/HANDBOOK.md`'s own walkthrough (rewritten
around the two items below) and `docs/COMMANDS.md`.

- **Quick setup by default**: the wizard's first screen offers "Quick
  setup" (Providers -> Default model -> Summary -- every role, including
  a spawned sub-agent, ends up on that one model) and "Full setup"
  (every step); Quick is the highlighted default, no confirm button
  needed. Full setup's own Summary gained "Change" jumps, one row per
  step this run actually used.
- **One "Team" step** replaces the "Agents" step and "Roles and lineup"
  step: a single "Custom roles: off / on" switch; off shows one sentence
  and nothing else; on shows Lineups (the active one checked, Enter
  edits, Ctrl+N/Ctrl+D) and Agents (Enter edits, Ctrl+N/Ctrl+D/Del) side
  by side at 120 columns, stacked behind a pane switch at 80. `--step
  team` reaches it; `--step agents`/`--step roles` (and `/setup`/`halo
  setup`'s own "team"/"roles" spellings) stay as aliases for the same
  screen. Turning custom roles off never disables delegation or the
  question card -- the shipped `standard` lineup still gives every role,
  including an unconfigured sub-agent, the default model.
- **A step rail** across the top of every step (current highlighted,
  done ticked); Ctrl+Left/Ctrl+Right walk it from anywhere, replacing the
  round-7 Ctrl+N/Ctrl+B (freed for "new"/"duplicate" below).
- **Autocomplete under a model field**: a filtered dropdown as you type,
  Enter picks, Escape closes it without leaving the screen underneath --
  the agent bio editor's preferred/fallback fields, the org editor's
  "Role or model", the lineup grid's "Agent or model" (suggests bio
  names, what that field actually holds), and a new quick filter above
  the role-template editor's own role list. Ctrl+P still opens the full
  picker everywhere.
- **Rule 1 (highlight is selection) and rule 7 (focus on open)** now
  apply to the default-model, permission-mode, theme and organization
  pickers too, with the same check mark the lineup pane already had;
  every step's own header is now one sentence naming its current choice
  ("Default model: `<ref>`. Enter to change.").
- A found-and-fixed Textual behaviour, documented in
  `tui/dialogs/agents_step.py`/`step_rail.py`: `DOMNode._merge_bindings`
  only reads `BINDINGS` off a class that is itself a `DOMNode` subclass
  -- a plain mixin's `BINDINGS` list is silently never bound. The new
  chords are plain tuples (`AGENTS_LIST_BINDINGS`, `STEP_RAIL_BINDINGS`)
  each concrete screen splices into its own `BINDINGS`; the action
  methods stay on the mixins, unaffected (ordinary method lookup).
- New modules, `init_wizard.py` growing by registration lines only:
  `tui/dialogs/wizard_ux.py` (the rule 1/2/6/7/8/9 helpers), `step_rail.
  py`, `autocomplete.py`, `setup_mode.py` (the Quick/Full chooser),
  `team_step.py` (`TeamStep`) -- `agents_step.AgentsStep` and `init_
  wizard.RolesStep` are gone, folded into it.

### Learned gateway rules

- **One engine for parameter rejections** (`providers/learned_params.py`,
  new): generalises the 1.0.1 gpt-6 `reasoning_effort`-with-tools rule
  (2.0.3-brief.md item G1) to every request field a gateway can reject
  that no existing specific check already owns -- `temperature`, `top_p`,
  `tool_choice`, `max_tokens`, `max_completion_tokens`, `thinking`,
  `output_config`, `response_format`, `parallel_tool_calls`, `strict`,
  `store`, `stream_options`, `metadata`, `stop` (the Databricks allowlist
  word), and the effort family itself on a wording the existing gpt-6/
  GLM/Claude checks don't recognize. On a 400/422 naming one of these, the
  smallest fix is planned (drop the field; clamp to the nearest allowed
  value when the message lists one -- the same "xhigh -> max" convention
  `profiles.clamp_effort` already uses for an effort-shaped value), the
  request is retried exactly ONCE, and -- only once that retry is
  CONFIRMED to have worked -- the fix is persisted to `~/.halo/learned-
  rules.json` under a new `"params"` sub-object (`{"<provider>:<model>":
  {"params": {"<field>": {"action", "value", "error", "date"}}}}`, beside
  every existing learned field in that same row) and announced with one
  house-voice transcript line ("Databricks rejected max_tokens on this
  endpoint; dropped it and retried; remembered for this endpoint"). A
  `model_table.json` row's own explicit `temperature`/`top_p` still wins
  outright over a learned rule (today's precedence, same rule `reasoning_
  effort_with_tools`/`tools_rejected` already follow); every later request
  against that same endpoint applies a FRESH (<=30 day) learned fix
  pre-emptively, before it ever pays for the round trip again; a rule
  older than 30 days is tried once bare before being relearned, so a
  since-fixed rejection self-heals with no action needed. `tools` keeps
  its own never-silently-drop handling and is deliberately never touched
  by this engine.
- **`halo rules` / `/rules`**: lists every learned parameter rule
  (endpoint, field, action, age); `--forget <provider:model>` (CLI) /
  `forget <provider:model>` (slash) clears one endpoint's rules; `halo
  models --forget-rules` clears every endpoint's at once.
- **`halo doctor --work --probe-all --learn`**: pre-learns by sending one
  minimal request per optional parameter (today: `temperature`/`top_p`/
  `stream_options`/`stop` -- the only watched fields that actually reach
  the wire through Databricks' own client-side body allowlist) to each
  configured endpoint -- opt-in, prints the cost estimate first, never
  sends a thing without the flag.
- Tests: `tests/test_learned_params.py` (new) -- every rejection shape
  seen so far (gpt-6 `reasoning_effort` + tools, GLM `thinking`, Claude
  `output_config` `xhigh`, an unknown-field 400, an allowed-values 422,
  and a 400 naming no field at all), the persistence shape, the 30-day
  stale-then-relearn behaviour, precedence, `--forget`/`--forget-rules`,
  the `xp:` ignored-parameters reader surviving the module split, and two
  live end-to-end runs against a mock Databricks gateway proving exactly
  one retry, the transcript line, and pre-emptive application on a later
  turn. No network, no real model.

### OpenAI-dialect Ollama hosts (round 5)

- **`ollama.hosts` entries learn an optional `"dialect": "openai"`** --
  an OpenAI-dialect GATEWAY in front of Ollama (a no-think proxy serving
  only `/v1/chat/completions` + `/v1/models`, with the entry's
  `api_key` as its bearer) can be used as a real `ol:` host, keeping the
  `ol:` provider identity (picker grouping, balances, error mapping)
  instead of burning an `or:` alias + `OPENROUTER_BASE_URL` override on
  it. The ref keeps parsing as `ol:` (native dialect, exactly as
  before); the flip happens where the host entry is already resolved --
  `providers.ollama.apply_host_dialect` (identity-preserving,
  idempotent, never changes a native host) is applied at Session
  construction, `set_model`, `call_small_model` (hooks/titles/`/local`)
  and the compaction-model override, so the whole session rides
  `call_openai_chat` with the host entry's own url (`/v1` added) and
  key. Catalog/enumeration (`get_catalog` -> `/local`/`/model`/`halo
  models`), the `halo ollama` panel's reachability probe, `halo doctor`
  (names the dialect per host) and `halo doctor --local` (the generic
  openai-chat sender) all read `/v1/models` for such a host. An
  unrecognized dialect value falls back to native with a doctor WARN
  naming the value. Tests: `tests/test_ollama_openai_host.py` (new) --
  parse/fallback, the doctor lines, a MockUpstream gateway end-to-end
  through a real `halo -p` child (path `/v1/chat/completions`, the
  host's own bearer, zero `/api/chat`), a native control child, and the
  per-dialect enumeration path.

### Deprecations

- **The legacy env file is no longer read.** `~/.config/vibes-hacker/env`
  (announced in the [2.0.1] CHANGELOG, WARNed by `halo doctor` since
  [2.0.2]) is no longer consulted by `load_provider_env_files()` --
  `~/.config/halo/env`/`HALO_ENV_FILE` is the only credential source now.
  The legacy file is never modified or deleted by this harness (other
  tools on the same box may still read it); `halo init`'s one-time copy-
  forward (copying its content into the new file, with an import marker,
  the first time `halo init` writes there) is unaffected and remains the
  migration path. `halo doctor` now WARNs specifically when the legacy
  file is the only one present (naming `halo init`), says nothing is
  wrong once the new file exists, and keeps its ordinary WARN when
  neither exists.

### The old name is gone

- **The previous project name is off the front pages** (owner's call,
  2026-10-06: "just don't mention it directly on the first pages of the
  repo, whatever if it's in the change logs"). `README.md`, the two
  INSTALL pages, `docs/HANDBOOK.md`, `docs/COMMANDS.md`, the package
  description in `pyproject.toml` and every line the installers print say
  only `halo`; where a legacy behaviour must be described they say "the
  previous name" or "pre-2.0 installs". The compatibility code, its
  tests, this CHANGELOG and the plans/ history are untouched on purpose
  -- the old command still works exactly as documented. A new house
  invariant (tests/test_invariants.py, (h)) refuses the name -- both
  separators, case-insensitive -- on exactly those front pages, with the
  pattern built from parts so even the test never spells it out. The
  installers' old-tool detection and uninstall commands build the name
  from parts too and behave identically.

### README and screenshots

- **`halo --version` prints an ASCII wordmark** -- a five-row figlet-style
  HALO banner from one new module (`halo_harness/banner.py`), with the
  version line underneath. The same banner is the first entry of the
  launch intro pool (it types out, then the version lands under the art)
  and the README's opening block; `tests/test_intro_lines.py` pins the
  README's copy against the module so the three can never drift.
- **`scripts/screenshots.py` renders the README's gallery** -- seven
  120x36 SVG scenes (first launch, a mid-turn with the phase line and a
  running tool card, the model picker, the wizard's Team step, the `/mcp`
  dialog with a failing server, a permission card, balances) driven by
  Textual pilots over fixture data only: a scripted FakeController,
  fixture picker rows, fixture bios and the shipped team templates, a
  fake MCP server list, a fixture permission ask, fixture balances.
  Deterministic by construction -- fixed seed, a frozen clock set through
  the same `started_at`/`_refresh` seams the tests use, Textual's random
  per-export CSS id normalized, LF line endings pinned by
  `.gitattributes` -- so a rerun is byte-identical. `tests/test_
  screenshots.py` re-renders and fails if the committed `docs/screenshots/
  *.svg` are not the script's exact output. The SVGs carry no real path,
  balance or model id (the session cwd is the literal `~/project`).
- **The README is restructured around them**: banner, one paragraph of
  what Halo is, the gallery with one-sentence captions, a two-column
  feature grid (routes, agent bios and lineups, the wizard, the MCP deep
  dive, learned rules, balances and picker columns, the privacy audit,
  CI and the release script), a three-line install, and a themes section
  the 2.0.8 theme pack (DOOM, Metroid, Mario) will fill with one render
  each.

### Release-review fix pass

Four blockers from the 2.0.5 release review, plus minors and nits. Each
fix has a pinning test in `tests/test_governor_review.py`,
`tests/test_agents_schedule.py` or `tests/test_teams_runtime.py`.

- **The Governor's retry ladder broke on real connections** (finding 1):
  every `call_*` opens one `http.client` connection and re-requests it,
  so an overload response that was never drained made the retry's
  `conn.request()` raise `ResponseNotReady` (surfacing as a connect
  failure the loop then retried as a 502) or corrupt the next parse. The
  retry branch now drains and closes the overload response before
  looping -- only the retry branch; a success (and the proxy's
  single-shot overload) still streams untouched.
- **The loop's "step aside" never fired for raised overload errors**
  (finding 2): `_step`'s UpstreamError branch passed the exception
  object where `(status, message)` was expected, so the check was always
  false and the loop re-ran its own backoff over 429/503 -- the exact
  double ladder round 4 removed (and GOVERNOR.md documented). Fixed; the
  pin drives a real turn against a 429 upstream with the Governor on and
  asserts exactly one loop-level attempt.
- **Cron schedules never fired** (finding 3): the next fire was computed
  from `now`, but `cron_next` returns a time strictly after its argument,
  so a due cron entry was never due. The next fire is now computed from
  the last fire point (or arming), like `every:` always did. The `5/2`
  step form (a single-value base with a step) also matches the whole run
  5,7,9,... now, not just 5 (nit 14).
- **A contended cross-process lock escaped the choke point** (finding 4):
  `LockFailed` after the 30 s lock timeout surfaced raw from every
  governed call (REVIEW item 4's warning + degraded flag + in-process
  fallthrough were never wired into `governed_upstream`). The acquire/
  report calls now catch it: one `warn_once` (which sets the degraded
  flag `is_degraded()`/doctor report), and the call proceeds ungoverned
  for that one call. A re-registered waiter (reaped between passes) is
  persisted immediately too (finding 7).
- **500 bodies were truncated at 2 KB** by the overload-peek (finding 5):
  the bounded read is 64 KB now.
- **Scheduled/triggered fires ran a bare prompt session, not the agent**
  (finding 6): both fire argv builders (`build_fire_argv`/`run_once`)
  pass `--agent` and `--team` when the entry carries them. The detached
  fallback (no live job registry) also spawns the argv LIST directly
  instead of a `shlex.join` string through `shell=True`, which cmd.exe
  mangles (nit 10), and `last_note` is written under the scheduler lock
  (nit 13).
- **A declined team escalation came back every turn** (finding 8): the
  decline path now sets `team.escalated`, so the card is shown once
  (the accepted switch already set it).
- **`HALO_GOVERNOR` typos silently forced the Governor on** (nit 9):
  only an explicit `1`/`true`/`yes`/`on` forces on and
  `0`/`false`/`no`/`off` forces off; any other value (case-insensitive)
  is ignored and config decides. The dead `select` import in
  `governor_state` is gone (nit 11). Learned-rules caching (nit 12) is
  deferred to 2.0.6.
- **A regression finding 2's fix introduced, caught by the pre-tag
  suite gate** (CI was red on it, both platforms): a post-connect
  transport drop (a dropped keep-alive, a mid-response RST) is
  re-labelled a plain 502 by the wire mapper, and the error translator
  then replaced its message with the canned 529 "gateway returned a bad
  response" sentence -- so the loop's new, working Governor step-aside
  mistook the drop for an overload the Governor had already paced and
  retried (it had not: the Governor paces HTTP response statuses only;
  a dropped connection produced no response). The turn died after phase
  1's single immediate re-dial instead of riding the backoff ladder.
  `is_post_connect_failure_message` now joins the byte-for-byte guard
  in the translator (beside the connect-failure wording it mirrors) and
  the ownership check declines it -- a dropped keep-alive retries on
  the loop's own ladder again, pinned both synthetically and against a
  real socket close with the Governor on.
- **A pure read no longer creates the Governor's state dir** (found by
  CI's real-state guard, red since round 4): `state_dir()` made the
  directory on every call, so `/gov`'s table, `halo doctor`'s gateway
  health and a plain state `load` conjured an empty `~/.halo/governor/`
  on a machine that had never run a governed call. Path resolution and
  directory creation are split now -- the three writers (the bucket
  lock, the state save, the call-log append) create it on demand, with
  the same one-warning degraded fallback when the dir cannot be made.

## [2.0.4] - 2026-10-06

### Tooling

- **GitHub Actions now runs the three suites on every push and pull
  request** (`.github/workflows/suites.yml`): `test_bridge.py`,
  `tests/run_all.py`, and `test_tui.py`, on Linux and Windows, Python
  3.12, each with its own hard timeout so one slow/hanging suite never
  hides the other two. A job summary shows pass/fail for all three at a
  glance; the full logs upload as a build artifact only on failure. The
  orchestrator's manual three-platform run is now the exception (real
  local models, real MCP servers, real hardware), not the normal way the
  suites get run -- see `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md`.
- **A release script** (`scripts/release.py <version>`) replaces the
  hand-run release checklist: refuses on a dirty tree under
  `halo_harness/`, `tests/`, or `docs/`; sets (or verifies)
  `halo_harness/__init__.py::__version__`; requires and dates the
  CHANGELOG's own `## [<version>] - unreleased` section; commits, tags,
  and pushes; refreshes the local install (printing the command instead
  of running it when a halo session looks like it's already running) and
  any `--remote user@host` given on the command line. `--dry-run` prints
  every step with nothing executed; `tests/test_release_script.py` drives
  it against a scratch git repo.
- **House invariants, one test per rule** (`tests/test_invariants.py`):
  no safety/refusal language in `halo_harness/`, `docs/`, or `tests/`; the
  network choke point; no file under `halo_harness/` bypassing
  `BRIDGE_TEST_HOME`; every slash command and CLI flag documented; the
  privacy scan; no test module exporting `BRIDGE_STATE_DIR` for its whole
  run. Several reference the module that already covered that ground
  (`tests/test_offline_mode.py`, `tests/test_privacy_scan.py`,
  `tests/test_docs_slash_commands.py`, `tests/test_docs_commands.py`)
  rather than duplicating it.

### History and privacy
- **History rewritten on 2026-10-05**: four stray cache files and a handful
  of already-fixed identifying strings were removed from every commit (never
  from the current tree; those were fixed long ago). Every commit hash
  changed and every `v*` tag was re-pointed. Re-clone, or run
  `git fetch && git reset --hard origin/master` in an existing checkout.

- **`halo audit privacy [--history] [--json] [--since <rev>]`**: scans
  the working tree by default (every tracked plus untracked, non-ignored
  file) for real user-profile paths, private-range and link-local IP
  literals, LAN hostnames and `.local` names, known machine/vendor names,
  stray `%SystemDrive%`/`%USERPROFILE%`-style cache files, key- and
  token-shaped strings, e-mail addresses, and any real path under the
  state dir; exits 1 when it finds anything, 0 when clean. `--history`
  runs the same rules over every distinct blob reachable from HEAD
  (scanned once each, reported at the earliest commit that introduced
  it), and splits the result into paths to remove entirely versus paths
  that stay with specific text needing replacement. `--json` gives the
  same fields as machine-readable output. Every excerpt this prints has
  already had the matched value replaced with `<redacted>` -- the real
  value never reaches the report. The rule set
  (`halo_harness/privacy_rules.py`) is the single source both this
  command and `tests/test_privacy_scan.py`'s own regression guard read,
  so the two can no longer drift apart.
- **`plans/2.0.4-history-rewrite-plan.md`**: the written plan for
  rewriting this repo's history (produced from a real `halo audit
  privacy --history --json` run against this repo) -- the paths to
  purge entirely, the text replacements, the tags to re-create, the two
  clones to reset, the verification steps, and the CHANGELOG
  announcement. Writing the plan does not run it: no history was
  rewritten, no force-push happened, and `git filter-repo` was not
  invoked, by this round.

### Experiential Labs

- **`xp:<slug>` route** onto the Experiential Labs gateway
  (`EXPLABS_API_KEY`), with its own `ProviderProfile` (none of
  OpenRouter's fields -- `usage.include`, a `provider` preference object,
  `transforms` -- are ever sent, since this gateway's own schema doesn't
  define them) and three dialects: chat completions by default, the
  Responses dialect shared with the `oai:` route per `experiential.
  dialect_overrides`, and -- for a Claude slug (`xp:claude-*`) -- Halo's
  existing native Anthropic passthrough at `/v1/messages` with
  `x-api-key`, so thinking stays native while an Anthropic-shaped rung
  serves the call. `tools`/`reasoning_effort`/structured output are each
  gated on that model's own catalog row.
- **Catalog** (`halo_harness/providers/experiential_catalog.py`): `GET
  /v1/models` cached with the same TTL every other catalog here uses,
  refreshed by `/models refresh`/`halo models --refresh`/launch
  auto-refresh; a vendored fallback snapshot
  (`halo_harness/providers/catalog/experiential-models.json`, built from
  already-published facts, no key, no secret) so a fresh install shows
  real context/price/capability columns before ever refreshing live.
- **Picker**: an "Experiential Labs" group with the same price/context
  columns every other group shows, plus a one-word data-policy badge
  (`zdr`/`no_training`). The shared column formatter (`model_display.
  format_price_per_m`) now also renders a negative per-token/per-million
  sentinel (an OpenRouter router model's own `-1`, e.g. `openrouter/auto`,
  `typesafe/jev-router`, `nvidia/switchyard`) as "varies" instead of a
  negative dollar figure, and exactly `$0` as "free".
- **Cost**: per-turn cost reads `usage.cost`; the serving `provider` and
  `is_byok` ride the same per-chunk capture OpenRouter's own `provider`
  field already uses, so the transcript's responding-provider label shows
  the real serving rung. `GET /api/v1/credits` feeds a balance line in
  `halo doctor`/`halo providers`; `halo stats --experiential` pages
  settled rows from `GET /api/v1/usage`. Every `xp:` chat-completions
  request carries `safety_identifier` set to the Halo session id
  (documented, opt-out) for per-session spend tracking.
- **Errors**: the gateway's own `error.code` (`unsupported_capability`,
  `unavailable_route`, `pro_required`, `invalid_key`, the `idempotency_
  conflict`/`idempotency_replay_unavailable` split on one shared HTTP
  409, ...) maps to one plain sentence each, checked before the generic
  status-code fallback. The `x-experiential-ignored-parameters` response
  header is learned per model and surfaced once as a notice, never
  repeated for an unchanged value.
- **Tool search**: `{"type": "openrouter:tool_search"}` plus per-tool
  `defer_loading: true`, converting Halo's own already-deferred-tool
  decision into this gateway's wire convention -- off by default behind
  `experiential.tool_search`.
- **Waterfall**: `gateway.retry.max_attempts_per_route` is always sent as
  `1` by default (Halo's own outer retry loop is already the outer
  layer); `gateway.routing`/`gateway.retry` are configurable via
  `experiential.routing`/`experiential.retry`. `/xp routes <slug>` prints
  the rung list from `GET /api/models/<slug>/providers`.
- **Enablement and doctor**: joins the generic `PROVIDER_NAMES`-driven
  `halo providers`/`/providers`/`/model` tables; an init wizard tab (key
  only, stored the same env-file-plus-reference way every other provider
  key is); `halo doctor` checks key presence, gateway reachability, and
  the credits balance.
- **Docs**: `docs/MODELS.md` "Experiential Labs" section (including a
  "How to run" table for Space Bunny Alpha, Nemotron 3.5 Lightning,
  Tencent hy4-preview and TypeSafe's jev-router), `docs/CONFIG.md`,
  `docs/COMMANDS.md`, `docs/SLASH-COMMANDS.md`, and the enablement
  prefix table (which also picked up the `oai:`/`cx:` rows it had been
  missing since those routes shipped).

### Roles wizard

Owner report: "the available models are not listed when you select edit a
role... there aren't models to pick from and/or autocomplete." Leaving
the init wizard's Providers step (Next) now runs ONE live, off-thread
enumeration of every provider `/model` knows (OpenRouter, Anthropic,
Databricks, Hugging Face, OpenAI, Experiential, the Claude Code/Codex
subscriptions, every Ollama host including a LAN one, local servers) --
with the credentials just typed into any tab this run (saved or not)
merged over the saved config, never written to disk by the enumeration
itself; one progress line per provider as it answers, a bounded wait so
a provider that never answers ("not reachable") never blocks the step.
The merged, grouped list (`providers/model_enumeration.py::
build_model_rows` -- the SAME function `Controller.list_models()`/
`/model` now delegates to) is cached for the rest of the wizard run and
reused by the Roles step, the Orgs step and the Summary step.

- **Pick list and autocomplete**: the round-1 role editor (`/roles edit`,
  the wizard's own "Edit roles...") and the org editor's free-text "Role
  or model" field both pick from that same merged, grouped, gym-scored
  list; typing narrows it (prefix/substring); a typed-only ref that
  matches nothing in it still works, with a one-line note. `/roles edit`/
  `/org edit` outside the wizard were already reading the live session's
  own `Controller.list_models()` -- unaffected.
- **The Auto tab**: a second tab in the role editor fills every role in
  one action (`ctrl+a`) from a built-in preset (`local-first`/`balanced`/
  `quality`), an installed TEAM TEMPLATE (below), or `halo gym propose`
  when this machine has saved gym data -- shows one line per role,
  switches back to the table so any row can still be adjusted by hand
  before `ctrl+s`.

### Agent bios and team templates

Owner: "each role should have a yaml file that can be editable too."
Two additive layers (`docs/AGENTS.md`): an **agent bio**
(`halo_harness/agents_yaml.py`, `~/.halo/agents/<name>.yaml`) describes
what one named agent IS -- models/tools/context/limits/output/
environment/acceptance, `extends:` for inheritance; a **team template**
("lineup", `halo_harness/teams_yaml.py`, `~/.halo/teams/<name>.yaml`)
ASSIGNS bios to roles (`agents:`, any number of assignments, several may
share a role, exactly one `role: main`; `roles: {...}` shorthand sugar
expands to the same shape) and positions (`org:`), with `delegation`/
`routing`/`budget`/`escalation`/`pipeline`/`permissions`/`context`
sections stored and shown (not yet enforced -- the 2.0.5 Governor's
job). Applying a template fills the EXISTING role table/org dict through
two resolution functions -- `RolesEditor`/`OrgEditor`/the Auto tab need
no changes to actually use one.

- Shipped starter bios (`general`/`coder`/`tester`/`judge`/`local-small`
  plus this project's own real development-cycle roster --
  `orchestrator`/`implementer`/`verifier`/`reviewer`/`researcher`/
  `release-manager`/`watchdog`) and team templates (`local-first`/
  `balanced`/`quality`, plus `halo-dev-cycle` -- this project's own cycle,
  seven assignments, the flagship multi-agent example).
- Import/export both ways with Claude Code's own `.claude/agents/*.md`
  frontmatter (`agents_md_bridge.py`) -- lossy by design; `docs/AGENTS.md`
  tables exactly which fields round-trip.
- `halo agents list|show|validate|new <name> [--from BIO]|edit|export
  [--claude-md]|import [--claude-md]` and `halo teams list|show|
  validate|new <name> [--from TEMPLATE]|use <name>|export|import`;
  `/agents` (extended with a bios section) and a new `/teams` in the
  TUI; `halo doctor --agents` validates every bio's shape and the ACTIVE
  team template, then runs each bio's own acceptance prompt against a
  real one-shot model call.
- The legacy role table migrates into a generated team template named
  `migrated` plus one bio per distinct model, on the first wizard save
  that sees one with no `migrated` template yet -- announced in one line,
  never runs again once it exists.
- **Dependency**: `pyyaml` added to pyproject (small, pure Python) --
  every bio/team-template YAML read or write goes through it.
- **Docs**: `docs/AGENTS.md` (new), linked from `docs/CONFIG.md`,
  `docs/SLASH-COMMANDS.md`, `docs/ROLES.md`.

### Catalogs

- **Databricks family fallback**: an endpoint id with no row in
  models.dev's own (30-id, already-stale) `databricks` provider entry now
  resolves through the VENDOR's own models.dev entry instead --
  `providers.models_dev.vendor_family_profile_fields` strips a leading
  `databricks-`, normalizes version punctuation (`opus-4-5` ->
  `opus-4.5`, `gemini-3-5-flash` -> `gemini-3.5-flash`; a parameter-count
  id like `gemma-3-12b` is left alone), and parses a Bedrock-style
  external endpoint id (`us-anthropic-claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929-v1-0` ->
  `claude-sonnet-4.5`, read off the serving-endpoints probe's own
  `foundation_model.name`). A row sourced this way carries a "vendor list
  price" marker in the picker; a `state.ready == false` endpoint is
  marked "not ready" there too.
- **The same fallback fills `or:`/`xp:` gaps**: an OpenRouter id with no
  vendored catalog row (keyed off its own `vendor/slug` id) and an `xp:`
  slug this session's cached catalog has no row for yet now resolve real
  context/price through the identical vendor lookup, instead of blank
  columns -- "the same gap Databricks had."
- **`:free` variants sort beside their paid row** in the `/model` picker
  under every sort key (price/context/speed), not just the "name" default
  that already happened to keep them adjacent -- a dedicated fixup pass
  re-glues a `<ref>:free` row next to its own `<ref>` row after the
  numeric re-sort scatters them apart (a free row's own $0 price usually
  sorts it to the front, ahead of its paid sibling, not after).
- **`xp:` contract alignment**, pinned against the gateway's own
  published `https://platform.experientiallabs.ai/llms.txt`: the
  retryable error-code set corrected to match the contract's own "Error
  envelope" table exactly (`gateway_draining`/`deadline_exceeded`/
  `internal_error` are retryable, not fixed; `provider_internal` removed
  -- not a real published code); `unsupported_parameter`'s own wording
  fixed to read as a 400 REFUSAL, never a silent drop; the dropped-field
  disclosure (`x-experiential-ignored-parameters`) now read from the
  response BODY the contract says it actually rides on, with the earlier
  header-based read kept as a defensive fallback; four more per-response
  headers captured (`x-gateway-provider`/`-zdr`/`-route-depth`/
  `-route-reason`, alongside the existing `x-request-id`) and carried on
  the session's own transcript log plus shown in `/xp routes`' new "last
  response" block; `is_byok` now also read from `usage.is_byok` (the
  contract's own stated location, kept alongside the earlier top-level
  read); `experiential.zdr` config key adds a per-request `"provider":
  {"zdr": true}` constraint to both `xp:` request builders; `halo stats
  --experiential --id <x-request-id>` looks up one call's `GET /api/v1/
  generation` for after-the-fact attribution.
- **Docs**: `docs/MODELS.md`'s "Experiential Labs" section gets a "Zero
  data retention" note and an expanded "Errors"/"Cost and credits"/
  "Waterfall" writeup, plus the vendor-family fallback documented under
  "The model table, catalogs, and refresh"; `docs/CONFIG.md`
  (`experiential.zdr`); `docs/COMMANDS.md` (`halo stats --experiential
  --id`).

### MCP deep dive

rolo: "I still cannot reconnect to many of the mcps ... we need like a
doctor deep dive option to fix these with the use of an llm."

- **A server that fails to connect stays listed as down**, with its last
  error AND the wall-clock time it happened (`last failed YYYY-MM-DD
  HH:MM:SS`, next to the reason) in `halo mcp list`/`halo mcp get`/
  `/mcp`; `McpServerHandle.last_error_at`/`tools_fetch_failed_error` are
  new (the latter: the real `tools/list` exception text, not just the
  bare bool) -- the status bar's own N/total already never dropped a
  configured server (verified, not a bug: `McpManager.status()` always
  returns one row per handle regardless of state), pinned here against
  a crashed server alongside a healthy one.
- **`halo doctor --mcp deep [name]` / `D` in `/mcp`**: per server, in
  order, each step bounded by a timeout and recorded with its own
  evidence (masked -- no key-shaped value ever printed): resolve the
  command (PATH, a Windows `.cmd`/`.bat`/`.ps1` shim's own interpreter, a
  bounded `node`/`python`/`uv` `--version`) or the url's shape; a bare
  TCP connect + a real TLS handshake for http/sse/ws; the real stdio/
  http/sse spawn+handshake (`initialize` then `tools/list`, each its own
  step -- a tools/list failure after a clean initialize is its own
  `tools_list` step, not folded into a hard failure) with all stdout/
  stderr captured; an env/PATH diff against the user's shell; the config
  entry's shape against Claude Code's own (user/local/project scope,
  managed, plugin). New `mcp/doctor_probe.py` (the bounded probes) and
  `mcp/doctor_deep.py` (the orchestrator) modules.
- **The model proposes ONE fix per failing server**: the evidence plus
  the server's masked config entry go to the session model (or
  `roles.judge` when configured, via the SAME throwaway-session plumbing
  `halo improve`'s own drafting call already established) with a fixed
  prompt for exactly one line -- `CONFIG_EDIT:`/`INSTALL:`/`PATH:`/
  `URL:`/`ENV:`. Shown always; applied only on a yes (`--apply` on the
  CLI, `A` in `/mcp`; `D` alone only diagnoses) and only for the three
  mechanically-appliable kinds (config edit/path/url -- an install
  command or an env-var name is always advisory, same "the line is for
  you to run" rule `install_hint` already follows, never auto-executed
  or auto-set in your shell). Applying re-tests; a fix that verifies
  healthy is learned by its failure signature (command basename + error
  class + a normalized stderr fingerprint, stable across a changing pid/
  timestamp) in `providers/learned_rules.py`'s new `learn_mcp_fix`/
  `learned_mcp_fix` rows, so the identical failure on ANY server self-
  heals automatically next time -- no model call, no fresh yes needed,
  announced in one line.
- **`/mcp` shows the deep dive as an action** (`D`/`A`, legend updated)
  and each server's own last diagnosis inline (when, the verdict, the
  fix proposed or applied) once one has run, persisted at `~/.halo/
  mcp-diagnosis.json`.
- **Corpus reader**: `halo doctor --mcp deep --from <dir>` reads a
  directory of captured `halo mcp test`/`halo bugreport` output and
  per-server logs (layout documented in `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md`) and
  runs the same propose step over the reconstructed evidence -- no live
  server needed, never applies anything (nothing to re-test against);
  for the orchestrator to feed the owner's real failures from a
  different box entirely.
- **Docs**: `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md`'s "MCP servers" section gets "The
  deep dive" writeup (steps, fix kinds, learned-rule behaviour, corpus
  layout); `docs/COMMANDS.md` (`halo doctor --mcp deep`); `docs/
  SLASH-COMMANDS.md` (`/mcp`'s `D`/`A`).

## [2.0.3.1] - 2026-10-05
- **The Claude Code bridge server starts inside a job object that forbids
  breakaway**: `spawn_server_detached` retries without
  CREATE_BREAKAWAY_FROM_JOB when CreateProcess denies it (GitHub-hosted
  Windows runners, some launchers); the server runs as a member of the job.

### Clipboard image paste

- **Ctrl+V/Shift+Insert paste a clipboard image, not just text.** When the
  clipboard carries an image, Halo reads it (Windows `Clipboard::GetImage`/
  `Get-Clipboard -Format Image`, WSL through `powershell.exe`, macOS
  `osascript`/`pngpaste`, Linux `wl-paste`/`xclip`/`xsel`, or Pillow's
  `ImageGrab.grabclipboard()` when installed -- no new hard dependency
  either way) and adds an attachment chip, `[Image #1 1024x768]`, to the
  prompt. A pasted/dragged path to an existing `.png`/`.jpg`/`.jpeg`/
  `.gif`/`.webp` file attaches that file the same way instead of inserting
  the path. `/paste` reads the clipboard the same way; `/paste <path>`
  attaches an existing file; `/images` lists pending attachments,
  `/images clear` removes all of them, Backspace the last one (same rule: only
  when the input is nothing but chip labels). Over SSH, where no remote
  clipboard reaches the terminal, one line says so and names `/paste
  <path>`/dragging a file instead.
- **Storage and limits.** A pasted image is saved to
  `~/.halo/attachments/<session-id>/clip-<n>.png`; downscaled (Pillow
  installed, long side over 1568px) or left as-is; refused with one line
  past a 5 MB hard cap. The session log stores the saved PATH, never the
  base64 -- resume/replay re-reads the file to rebuild the real image
  block, with a plain text note instead when the file is gone.
- **Every route actually sends the image** once it reaches a turn:
  `ant:`/`cc:`/`dbx:` Claude keep the native image block; `or:`/`oai:`/
  `hf:`/`xp:`/Databricks-other get an `image_url` data URL (chat
  completions) or a real `input_image` item (the OpenAI Responses
  dialect, previously a visible omission placeholder); `ol:` sends the
  base64 on Ollama's own native `images` field; `cx:` passes the saved
  path with `codex exec -i <path>`. A model whose catalog row says it has
  no vision gets one notice and the saved path rides as plain text
  instead of a provider 400.
- **Print mode and SDK parity**: `--image <path>` (repeatable) on `halo -p`
  attaches images to that one turn; `--input-format stream-json` accepts
  `image` content-block entries (a file path, inline base64, or the full
  Anthropic image-block shape a real Claude Code client already sends).

## [2.0.3] - 2026-10-05

### Launch intro pool

- **The typewriter intro rotates through a pool of lines** instead of
  always `I am just a copy, of a copy, of a copy...`: a random pick from
  `tui/intro_lines.py` on every fresh launch (the Red Dragon line among
  them), `/intro` replays a fresh pick and `/intro <n>` replays line n.
  Add a line by appending to the pool; nothing else changes.

Local and cloud models: Ollama + Hugging Face + the OpenAI API + a Codex
subscription (`plans/2.0.3-ollama-round2-brief.md` and onward). Rounds 1
through 5i landed: research, the `ol:` provider, hardware/host analysis and
roles, the `hf:` route, `hf:local/*`/the shared `/local` view/the init tab,
GPU and Experiential Labs research (docs only), local-model excellence
(fit calibration, constrained tool calls, per-OS doctor checklist),
finding and serving/importing file-backed models, the model gym and
data-driven roles, the experimental Apple Silicon `hf:mlx/*` backend,
enforced offline mode/hybrid escalation/the savings meter, the `oai:`
route, and the `cx:` route with Codex settings read beside Claude Code's.
Round 5h (Experiential Labs fully integrated as its own `xp:` route) was
cut from this version by the owner and moved to 2.0.4 round 1 -- item 5
below, originally reserved for it, instead covers the research-only docs
that did ship. Round 6 (this pass: the user-facing local/cloud-models
guide, the research carry-forward, the live-check record, and this
CHANGELOG/README pass) closes out the version; the Opus review, a fix
pass, and the release tag are still to come.

1. **`ol:` provider on Ollama's native API** (round 2): a new `ollama`
   dialect reaches a local daemon, a named LAN host, or Ollama Cloud, all
   through the identical native `/api/chat` request shape --
   `ol:<model>` (the default host) or `ol:<model>@<hostname>` (an entry in
   `~/.halo/config.json`'s `ollama.hosts`). `options.num_ctx` is computed
   and sent on EVERY request (`min(trained context, host.max_ctx,
   131072)`, never a Modelfile default), `keep_alive` is sent only when
   the host entry configures one (the server's own `OLLAMA_KEEP_ALIVE`
   stands otherwise), and `think` is mapped from the session's effort level
   (graded low/medium/high for gpt-oss, bool for every other thinking
   model). The NDJSON streaming decoder synthesizes its own stable
   `toolu_` tool-call ids (Ollama's wire format sends none, only a 0-based
   index) and maps `done_reason: "length"` onto the existing max-tokens
   stop handling; `done_reason: "load"` retries the turn once when nothing
   has been shown yet. A background `/api/version` probe, a short-TTL
   `/api/tags` + `/api/show` catalog per host, and a cheap real-tool-call
   capability probe (cached per model digest, independent of what
   `/api/show` merely declares) round out this round. Round 2b wires the
   dialect into the agent loop itself (`agent/loop.py`'s request/stream
   dispatch, `headless.py`'s shared credential resolver) -- an `ol:` model
   now runs a full turn, including a tool call, end to end in print mode
   and the TUI. Docs: `docs/MODELS.md` ("Ollama" section + the ref-form
   table), `docs/CONFIG.md` (`ollama.hosts`, `OLLAMA_HOST`/
   `OLLAMA_API_KEY`), `docs/LOCAL-MODELS.md` (round 6, the new guide).
2. **Hardware/host analysis, the fit estimate, and roles** (round 3):
   `/ollama` (TUI dialog) and `halo ollama [--host NAME] [--refresh]`
   (CLI) render one page per configured host -- reachable, version,
   loaded models' `size` vs `size_vram` as one plain offload sentence,
   trained vs. effective context, and the KV-bytes/token figure (standard
   GGML/llama.cpp accounting, not independently re-derived); `halo doctor`
   gains a one-line-per-host Ollama section. The context-ownership rule's
   `fit_estimate` (round 2 always passed `None`) is now real: the largest
   power-of-two context that fits in free GPU memory after a model's own
   weights, from the OS GPU tool for a LOCAL host (`nvidia-smi` on
   Windows/Linux, verified live this round) or a REMOTE host's own
   already-loaded `/api/ps` context when there's one to read, cached
   about a minute so a turn never shells out more than once in that
   window. The `ol:` ProviderProfile's `tools_max` now follows that
   effective context's class (under 16k/16k-32k/32k-64k/64k+ -> 16/32/
   64/128 tools, `ollama.tools_max` overridable, never below this
   platform's own built-in tool count) instead of round 2's permanently-
   unbounded `None` -- the SAME SessionCatalog cap-shrink/LRU-evict `/
   model` already runs on a provider switch does the actual shrinking,
   never a second capping path. Local `ol:` models default to a
   supporting role (the picker's new `u` action pre-selects `small`,
   never main); choosing one as the session's main model anyway prints
   the plain consequence sentence when it doesn't declare tool-calling
   support, and proceeds regardless. `/local <question>` (Ollama-only
   this round) answers from `roles.small` inline, without adding
   anything to the main transcript's context. Fix pass after a live run:
   the fit estimate now consults `/api/ps` before any GPU-memory
   arithmetic (an already-loaded model's own loaded context wins outright,
   never recomputed, so concurrent requests can no longer disagree and
   force a reload), counts other loaded models' `size_vram` as reclaimable
   headroom, and -- when the weights provably don't fit even after that --
   falls back to a conservative 8192 instead of the 131072 hard cap.
   Round 5b (local-model excellence) builds directly on this: `halo
   ollama calibrate <model> [--host NAME] [--start N]` loads a model at a
   candidate `num_ctx` and steps down by powers of two, reading `/api/ps`
   back, until it is fully resident -- the measured `max_full_gpu_ctx`
   (or "does not fit") is recorded in `~/.halo/ollama-fit.json` and never
   expires on its own (re-measured only by an explicit re-run, or
   automatically when the model's digest or the server's version
   changes); the SAME procedure runs automatically the first time a model
   is used on a host with no learned cap, with one plain notice
   (`ollama.auto_calibrate: false` opts out). The context-ownership rule
   now takes that learned cap as its highest-priority "fit" candidate
   (still just one more entry in the same `min()`, never an override that
   bypasses the trained-context/hard-cap ceiling), and a REMOTE host with
   nothing known at all -- the MUST-FIX from a live LAN-host run -- gets a
   conservative 32768 default instead of silently falling through to the
   131072 hard cap (`ollama.hosts[].max_ctx` is the documented explicit
   override). The KV-bytes-per-element constants are corrected from
   llama.cpp's own `ggml-common.h` block structs (q8_0 1.0625, q4_0
   0.5625 -- both old approximations under-counted memory by 6-12%),
   selectable per host via `ollama.hosts[].kv_cache_type`. Multi-GPU: the
   fit estimate now SUMS every detected card's free memory (never the
   minimum) minus a per-card overhead. `ollama.hosts[].ssh: "user@host"`
   adds an OPTIONAL read-only GPU probe over ssh for a remote host
   (never required). Apple Silicon's unified-memory share is estimated
   from total RAM (or `iogpu.wired_limit_mb` when set) and always
   labelled an estimate -- calibration is the ground truth there too. The
   system message/tools/`options` on an `ol:` session are now pinned
   byte-stable turn to turn (so Ollama/llama.cpp can actually reuse the
   cached prompt prefix); the status bar's model chip and `halo ollama`
   now show the last turn's own tokens/second, prefill seconds, and an
   "offloaded" marker. Round 5b part 2 (local-model excellence,
   continued): on the `ollama` dialect (local hosts only) and `hf:local/*`
   servers, a turn Halo decides is EXPECTED to call a tool (tools are
   offered, it isn't the first turn, and the last message is a tool
   result -- `providers/tool_call_schema.py`, the one documented rule
   every caller shares) sends the tool-call schema as the output
   constraint (`format` for `ol:`, alongside `tools` unchanged;
   `response_format` json_schema for `hf:local/*`), falling back to
   unconstrained decoding on a bare 400; a tool call that still fails to
   parse (bad JSON, or a resolved tool whose arguments fail schema
   validation) gets ONE isolated, tools-less local repair round -- the
   exact schema plus the parse error, re-validated before trusting it --
   before the existing plain error ever surfaces; the `ollama`/
   `huggingface` profiles also gain the generic bare-JSON/fenced-JSON
   leak-parser patterns, so a constrained reply that lands in plain text
   instead of native `tool_calls` still gets promoted. VRAM-aware role
   defaults: when the main model is `ol:` on a host where a second
   model's own weights plus the main model's CURRENTLY RESIDENT size
   would exceed the host's total GPU memory, `small`/`researcher`/
   `judge`/`subagent_default`'s TABLE value (never an explicit per-run
   `--role`/`/roles set` override) redirects to the main model instead of
   evicting it -- `/local <question>` applies the same redirection at call
   time; `halo roles`/`/roles` and the picker's `u` action show `(same as
   main: fits beside it: no)` as the reason. `halo ollama doctor [--host
   NAME]` (and `halo doctor`'s matching section) prints the documented
   host-tuning recommendations Halo cannot read back
   (`OLLAMA_FLASH_ATTENTION=1`, `OLLAMA_KV_CACHE_TYPE=q8_0`,
   `OLLAMA_NUM_PARALLEL=1`, `OLLAMA_KEEP_ALIVE`, `OLLAMA_CONTEXT_LENGTH`)
   and exactly where each lives per OS of the host (Windows tray app,
   macOS menu-bar app plus `launchctl setenv`, Linux `systemctl edit
   ollama`), with a one-line hint for a loopback-only host. The `Ollama`/
   `Hugging Face` init-wizard tabs now open with a detection summary (GPU/
   unified memory, Ollama's own models and what fits, running local
   servers, model folders known so far), filled in off the UI thread.
   `mlx_lm.server` (Apple's OpenAI-compatible MLX runtime, same default
   port family as llama-server) is told apart from llama-server by
   whether `/props` answers, labelled `MLX` in `/local`; `mlx-community/*`
   Hub-cache repos are labelled runnable through MLX; LM Studio's own
   model folder (`~/.lmstudio/models`, `huggingface.lmstudio_models_dir`
   overridable) joins the Hub-cache scan under its own group. `halo
   ollama calibrate` now also steps UP from a fitting first guess
   (bounded by the model's own trained context and the 131072 hard cap)
   to find the true ceiling instead of settling for the first lucky guess
   (`--no-up` skips it); the auto-calibrate notice now also surfaces from
   `call_small_model` (via the log, since that call path has no event
   stream of its own to protect) and `_run_compaction` (as an ordinary
   `notification` event), not just the main turn. Docs: `docs/MODELS.md`
   ("Ollama" section: Fit calibration, Host setup checklist, VRAM-aware
   role defaults), `docs/CONFIG.md` (`ollama.tools_max`,
   `ollama.auto_calibrate`, `ollama.hosts[].kv_cache_type`/`.ssh`),
   `docs/COMMANDS.md` (`halo ollama`, `halo ollama calibrate`, `halo
   ollama doctor`), `docs/ROLES.md`, `docs/LOCAL-MODELS.md` (round 6).
3. **`hf:` route -- Hugging Face Inference Providers router and dedicated
   Inference Endpoints** (round 4): a new `huggingface` provider reusing
   the existing openai-chat request/stream code unchanged (no new wire
   format -- tools supported, reasoning passthrough like OpenRouter's own,
   no host-specific fields). `hf:<org>/<model>` (optionally `:fastest`/
   `:cheapest`/`:preferred`/`:<provider>`, passed through verbatim on the
   wire) against the router (`https://router.huggingface.co/v1`,
   `Authorization: Bearer $HF_TOKEN`, `BRIDGE_HF_ROUTER_BASE_URL`
   overridable for tests); `hf:endpoint/<name>` against a fully separate
   `huggingface.endpoints` config entry's own `url`/`token` (mirroring
   `ollama.hosts`' shape) -- the two credential sources never cross-wire.
   An optional `huggingface.bill_to` org name adds `X-HF-Bill-To` on router
   requests only. The router's `GET /v1/models` catalog is cached
   (`~/.halo/huggingface-models.json`, the same TTL knob every other
   network catalog here shares) and surfaces in the `/model` picker under
   a "Hugging Face" group once enabled, with no network cost to the
   picker's first paint when the provider isn't configured. Enablement
   (`HF_TOKEN` present OR at least one endpoint configured), `/providers`/
   `halo providers`/`doctor`'s provider count, and `resolve_model_profile`
   all cover the new provider; a missing/misconfigured credential gives a
   plain message naming the right config key instead of the generic
   "OpenRouter not configured" every other unconfigured chat-dialect route
   used to get mislabeled as. `tests/helpers/mock_openai.py`'s `MockUpstream`
   gained a `path_prefix`/`expected_bearer`/`models_response` constructor
   option so the SAME scripted scenarios serve as the router and endpoint
   stand-ins, rather than a second fake server. Docs: `docs/MODELS.md`
   ("Hugging Face" section, Inference Providers/dedicated endpoints),
   `docs/CONFIG.md` (`HF_TOKEN`, `huggingface.endpoints`,
   `huggingface.bill_to`), `docs/LOCAL-MODELS.md` (round 6).
4. **`hf:local/*`, the shared `/local` view, the init tab** (round 5): a
   new `huggingface.local_servers` config list (`{name, url, api_key,
   default}`, mirroring `ollama.hosts`/`huggingface.endpoints`) names a
   MANUAL local/LAN OpenAI-compatible server -- `hf:local/<model>` (the
   default entry, else the first auto-detected one) or `hf:local/<model>
   @<name>`; a manual entry's own `api_key` is pinned apart from both
   `HF_TOKEN` and an endpoint's own token. Auto-detection probes `GET
   /v1/models` on 127.0.0.1 only, on llama-server/TGI's 8080, vLLM/
   `transformers serve`'s 8000 (treated identically on purpose), and LM
   Studio's 1234 -- overridable via `huggingface.local_probe_ports`/
   `HF_LOCAL_PROBE_PORTS` for tests, gated by `BRIDGE_TEST_NO_BACKGROUND_
   NET` like every other background probe; a manual entry is only ever
   probed on demand (`/local refresh`). Context length is read back from
   `/v1/models` (`max_model_len` for vLLM, other names tried heuristically)
   or, as a fallback, llama-server's own `/props` -- never requested.
   `providers.huggingface_hub_cache` walks `$HF_HUB_CACHE`/`$HF_HOME/hub`/
   `~/.cache/huggingface/hub` for models on disk but not necessarily
   served, reporting size and format (`safetensors`/`gguf`) without
   following a symlink outside the cache. The shared `/local` view
   (`providers.local_models`) merges Ollama hosts, running Hugging Face
   local servers, and the Hub cache into one grouped list -- `/local` (TUI,
   no args) opens a dialog, `halo local [--refresh]`/`/local`'s print-mode
   fallback render the same text; `/local <question>` (round 3) now also
   accepts an `hf:` `roles.small` ref, not just `ol:`. `halo init`'s
   interactive Providers step gains `Ollama (local or LAN)` and `Hugging
   Face` tabs (both additive/skippable; neither joins the OLD sequential
   `--provider`/`--preset` CLI picker, which has no sensible hardcoded
   default model for either). `tests/test_privacy_scan.py` now also scans
   untracked, non-ignored files (`git ls-files --others --exclude-
   standard`), not just tracked ones.

   Round 5c adds a fourth discovery source the user controls directly:
   `huggingface.model_dirs`, a list of folders scanned recursively
   (depth-limited, never following a symlinked subdirectory) for `.gguf`
   files and safetensors/MLX model folders (`config.json` beside
   `*.safetensors`) -- managed with `/local add <path>`/`/local forget
   <path>` (persisted immediately) or the init wizard's new "Local
   models" step (right after Providers; a folder field, a preferred-
   runtime choice, and the SAME detection summary round 5b part 2 already
   built). The fit estimate for any of these three on-disk sources (Hub
   cache, LM Studio, `model_dirs`) now comes straight from the FILE: a
   minimal GGUF header reader (`providers.gguf_header`, magic/version/
   key-value metadata, never reading past the metadata block) and a
   safetensors `config.json` reader (`providers.safetensors_config`) both
   build the identical `model_info` shape `/api/show` already produces,
   feeding round 3's `kv_bytes_per_token`/`fit_estimate` unchanged --
   `halo local` now shows format, size, trained context, quantization,
   and whether anything on this machine can actually run each file.
   Two ways to use one: `halo local serve <model> [--runtime llama-
   server|mlx_lm] [--port N] [--keep]` (or the `/local` dialog's `s` key)
   starts a managed child process on a free loopback port, recorded in
   `~/.halo/run/local-servers.json` and stopped when Halo exits unless
   `--keep`; when no runtime is found, Halo offers to fetch the pinned
   llama.cpp release for this OS/GPU backend (asset chosen from the
   NVIDIA driver's own reported CUDA version, Metal on macOS, Vulkan
   otherwise; verified against the GitHub Releases API's own per-asset
   `digest`, since llama.cpp publishes no checksum file of its own) into
   `~/.halo/runtimes/<version>/`, never on PATH, after a plain consent
   sentence (`--yes` or a stdin yes/no) -- `halo local runtime remove`
   deletes it. `halo local import <model> [--name NAME]` is the other
   way: a Modelfile (`FROM <path>`) and Ollama's own `/api/create`
   (streamed status lines as progress) turn a `.gguf` file into an
   ordinary `ol:<name>` -- GGUF only this round, since Ollama's own
   documented list of importable safetensors architectures wasn't found
   in this round's research. Either way the new model defaults to the
   `small` role, same as any other local model.

   Fix pass after a live run found two defects: the runtime fetch listed
   `GET /releases/latest`, which points at llama.cpp's own most recent
   NON-binary release (the actual compiled builds are prereleases tagged
   `b<number>`) -- Halo now lists `GET /releases` and walks it newest-tag-
   first for one that actually carries the needed asset; the CUDA pick is
   now "same major as the driver with minor <= the driver's, else the
   newest 12.x build, else Vulkan" (a driver reporting CUDA 13.2 with only
   12.4/13.4 builds available correctly falls back to 12.4, never silently
   picks a build its own minor version can't actually run), pulls in the
   paired `cudart-*` redistributable unless a CUDA toolkit is already
   installed, and the consent sentence now names the smaller `--backend
   vulkan` alternative's size; `--backend cuda|vulkan|cpu|metal` overrides
   the pick outright. Separately, the import path's `modelfile`/`FROM
   <path>` form turned out obsolete on a real daemon (`HTTP 400`,
   "neither 'from' or 'files' was specified") -- it now computes the
   file's sha256, uploads the blob (`POST /api/blobs/sha256:<hex>`,
   streamed from disk) only when `HEAD` says Ollama doesn't already have
   it, and calls `/api/create` with a `files` map naming that blob,
   exactly matching a live daemon (build 0.34.2). A second fix pass closed
   a POSIX-only zombie-process bug in the managed-server registry: a bare
   `SIGTERM` with no `wait()`/`waitpid()` left a stopped server as a
   zombie on Kali/WSL (gone in every practical sense, but still "alive" to
   a bare `os.kill(pid, 0)`) -- stopping now reaps a same-process child via
   its retained `Popen` handle, or polls `waitpid`/escalates to `SIGKILL`
   after a grace period for a fresh `halo local stop` process with no
   handle at all; Windows' own termination path is unchanged. Docs:
   `docs/MODELS.md` ("Hugging Face" section: `hf:local/*`, "Finding and
   using file-backed models"), `docs/CONFIG.md`
   (`huggingface.local_servers`, `.local_probe_ports`, `.model_dirs`,
   `.preferred_runtime`, `.lmstudio_models_dir`), `docs/COMMANDS.md`
   (`halo local`, `halo local serve`/`stop`/`import`/`add`/`forget`/
   `runtime remove`), `docs/SLASH-COMMANDS.md` (`/local`),
   `docs/LOCAL-MODELS.md` (round 6).
5. **Research: GPU/host telemetry, and Experiential Labs' gateway**
   (round 5a, round 5g -- docs only, no code). `docs/harness/
   GPU-RESEARCH.md` (round 5a, WebFetch-sourced, URLs per claim): exact
   probe flags per vendor/OS (NVIDIA confirmed live; AMD `rocm-smi`/
   sysfs, Intel `xpu-smi`, Apple `system_profiler` stay UNCONFIRMED --
   no such hardware reachable this round), multi-GPU split arithmetic,
   the llama.cpp release/asset matrix feeding round 5c's runtime fetch,
   KV-cache quantization per backend, and the mlx-lm comparison plan round
   5f's Mac live-check follows -- its corrections (KV bytes/element,
   llama.cpp has no checksum file of its own) are already folded into
   items 2 and 4 above. `docs/harness/EXPERIENTIAL-RESEARCH.md` (round
   5g, WebFetch-sourced): the gateway's request grammar, catalog shape,
   cost field location (`usage.cost`, not top-level), the local `exp run`
   gateway, and the `jev-latest` model -- this slot was originally
   reserved for Experiential Labs' full integration (an `xp:` route); the
   owner cut that scope from 2.0.3 on 2026-10-05 and moved it to 2.0.4
   round 1, so only the research doc ships here. Docs:
   `docs/harness/GPU-RESEARCH.md`, `docs/harness/EXPERIENTIAL-RESEARCH.md`.
6. **The model gym, data-driven roles, and the 60-second acceptance
   check** (round 5d): `halo gym [--models ol:a,ol:b,...] [--roles
   small,judge,...] [--quick]` runs a fixed task battery against each
   local model on THIS machine's own hardware, through the real request/
   decode path -- tool-call accuracy (schema-valid Read calls, with
   malformed/missing ones given exactly one local repair round, counted
   separately from the headline score), edit success (a real Edit call
   applied to a scratch fixture file and diffed), context recall (a
   needle at about 12% depth of a prompt sized to the model's own fitted
   context), instruction adherence (one word when asked for one word, no
   preamble when asked for none), and tokens/second + prefill seconds
   averaged across every real turn sent. `--quick` halves the battery
   size. Results persist at `~/.halo/gym/<host-slug>/<digest>.json` with
   the digest/quantization/fitted-context/Ollama-version/timestamps they
   were measured at; `halo gym show [model]` prints a per-model card.
   `halo gym propose [--apply] [--roles ...] [--main REF]` turns those
   scores into a role-table proposal -- the best LOCAL model per
   supporting role (`small`/`researcher`/`judge`/`subagent_default`),
   weighted per role's own priorities, with the round 5b VRAM-aware rule
   applied to the winner via the existing `roles.vram_aware_override`
   (never a second mechanism); `main` is never touched. One plain
   sentence per role names the composite score behind the choice; `--apply`
   saves the proposal as an ordinary role template through the EXISTING
   `halo roles template import` path. The `/model` picker shows a saved
   gym score (and tok/s) beside a model when one exists. `halo doctor
   --local [--model ol:x]` is the 60-second "works out of the box" proof
   per machine -- load, one real tool call, one structured-output call
   (the same constrained-decoding path the repair loop uses), and one
   summary of a fixture transcript, each printed `[PASS]`/`[FAIL]` with a
   plain reason and the elapsed time, always in that order even after an
   earlier FAIL; docs point a new local-model user at this command first.
   17 new tests (`tests/test_gym_5d.py`, `tests/test_gym_propose_5d.py`,
   `tests/test_doctor_local_5d.py`), hermetic throughout -- never a real
   model.

   Fix pass (2026-10-04, live run on qwen3.8:27b, a thinking-by-default
   model): context recall and instruction adherence scored a flat,
   unexplained 0% -- a 16/32-token output budget left no room for the
   model's own reasoning before the real answer, so the reply came back
   genuinely empty (the NDJSON decoder never turns `message.thinking`
   into checked text in the first place, confirmed with a dedicated
   pin). Both tasks now request a flat 160-token budget; `halo gym
   [show] --show-replies` prints each reply-only task's actual excerpt,
   and the same excerpts are always saved in the result JSON under each
   metric's own `samples` key, so a future 0% is diagnosable without
   re-running anything; the needle check is also now case-insensitive. 5
   more tests pin the thinking/text separation, the new token budget on
   the wire, the tolerant needle match, and the samples/`--show-replies`
   round trip -- live-verified against the real qwen3.8:27b daemon
   (instruction adherence and context recall both went from 0% to 100%).
   Docs: `docs/MODELS.md` ("The model gym" section), `docs/COMMANDS.md`
   (`halo gym`, `halo gym show`, `halo gym propose`, `halo doctor
   --local`), `docs/ROLES.md` ("Data-driven roles"), `docs/
   LOCAL-MODELS.md` (round 6).
7. **`hf:mlx/<org>/<repo>` -- Apple Silicon in-process backend, experimental**
   (round 5f): an optional extra, `uv tool install "halo-harness[mlx]"`
   (`pyproject.toml`'s own `mlx` group, an environment marker restricting
   it to macOS on arm64 -- never attempted on any other platform), adds a
   route that resolves a Hugging Face Hub repo id straight to a Halo-
   managed `mlx_lm.server` on a free loopback port: started with `--model
   <repo>` (mlx-lm downloads/reuses the Hub cache itself on first use; a
   plain notice names the repo, its approximate cached size when known,
   and the cache destination), recorded in round 5c's own managed-server
   registry (`~/.halo/run/local-servers.json`), reused by an EXACT repo-id
   match on every later use (never the generic `hf:local/*` "most
   recently started wins" fallback, which would silently hand a specific
   `hf:mlx/<repo>` ref a DIFFERENT repo's server), stopped when the
   session that started it exits unless kept, and stoppable by hand with
   `halo local stop <repo>`. Rides the EXISTING `hf:local/*` tiers
   end to end (`ModelRef.local=True` alongside the new `ModelRef.mlx=True`):
   tools, the repair loop and constrained decoding, the `small`-by-default
   role, the fit arithmetic, tokens/second, `halo doctor --local --model
   hf:mlx/<repo>`, and `halo gym --models hf:mlx/<repo>,ol:<model>`; on
   any platform that isn't Apple Silicon, resolving the ref gives exactly
   one plain sentence, "MLX runs on Apple Silicon only," and nothing else
   changes (`halo doctor` itself only ever mentions the extra on Apple
   Silicon too). `halo local serve <repo> --runtime mlx_lm` is the
   explicit, non-`--model` form of the same route; the `/local` view
   labels an `mlx-community/*` Hub-cache repo with this exact `hf:mlx/*`
   ref and the explicit `--runtime mlx_lm` serve hint. `doctor_local.py`
   gained a second, provider-agnostic request sender (`providers.
   huggingface_send`, the openai-chat dialect `gym_send.py`'s Ollama-only
   sender has no branch for) so `halo doctor --local` now also accepts an
   `hf:local/*`/`hf:mlx/*` `--model`, not just `ol:`. New tests across
   `tests/test_providers_huggingface_mlx.py`, `tests/test_doctor_local_
   mlx.py`, and `tests/test_huggingface_mlx_extras.py` -- hermetic
   throughout (a fake stub process stands in for `mlx_lm.server`, the
   Apple-Silicon platform check is injectable, and the non-macOS sentence
   is pinned on this suite's own real, non-Apple-Silicon host); the live
   check is the owner running [docs/MAC.md](docs/MAC.md)'s quick-start
   on his own Mac. Docs: `docs/MODELS.md` ("Apple Silicon" section),
   `docs/MAC.md` (the full quick-start), `docs/COMMANDS.md` (`halo local
   serve --runtime mlx_lm`), `docs/LOCAL-MODELS.md` (round 6, with a
   pointer to MAC.md).
8. **Trust and escalation: enforced offline mode, hybrid escalation, saved
   versus cloud** (round 5e): `halo --offline`/`/offline on|off`/
   `network.offline` make the one HTTP choke point (`providers/http.py`'s
   `open_upstream`/`urlopen_tls`) refuse any connection whose host isn't
   loopback or an allow-listed local host (every `ollama.hosts`,
   `huggingface.local_servers`, or managed-local-server-registry entry) --
   update checks, catalog refreshes, the Hugging Face router, OpenRouter,
   Databricks, Anthropic, and the WebFetch/WebSearch tools all refuse the
   same way (one plain sentence, "offline mode: not connecting to
   \<host\>", never retried); the claude.ai connectors bridge's background
   discovery is skipped instead (its real network call runs inside a
   spawned `claude` subprocess, outside this choke point) while an
   explicit `--refresh`/reconnect still runs it. A new invariant test
   greps the tracked tree for every raw `urllib`/`http.client` call site
   and fails on one outside the choke point with no listed, reasoned
   exception (today's exceptions: the MCP SDK's own httpx/websockets
   transport for `http`/`sse`/`ws` MCP servers and `mcp/oauth.py`'s token
   calls -- a separate, user-configured-server concern, not this round's
   scope). **Hybrid escalation** (`routing.escalation`: `{to, when:
   [low_confidence, tool_failures, context_overflow], ask}`) is local-
   first and only ever evaluated on an `ol:`/`hf:local/*`/`hf:mlx/*`
   session: `low_confidence` reuses the EXACT role-resolution + one-shot-
   call shape `roles.small` answers already use, pointed at the `judge`
   role instead (never a new judging mechanism); `tool_failures` counts
   `is_error` tool results in the current turn; `context_overflow` is the
   existing compaction-overflow retry path. `ask: true` (default) only
   notifies; `ask: false` switches for the rest of the turn (the two mid-
   turn triggers) or from the next model call on (`low_confidence`), with
   a transcript note; a role-table entry's own `"escalation": false` turns
   it off per role. `/escalation` shows the policy and this session's last
   decisions. **Saved versus cloud**: the cost meter also prices an `ol:`/
   `hf:local/*`/`hf:mlx/*` turn's tokens against the session's escalation
   target (or, when none is configured, the median price across the
   package's own vendored fallback catalogs -- no network call, works
   identically under `--offline`), accumulating the difference; the status
   bar's cost chip gains a " · saved $x" suffix and `/cost` prints the
   full breakdown (turns, tokens, the reference price and why). Docs:
   `docs/CONFIG.md` (`network.offline`, `routing.escalation`),
   `docs/COMMANDS.md` (`--offline`), `docs/SLASH-COMMANDS.md` (`/offline`,
   `/escalation`, the extended `/cost`), `docs/MODELS.md` (one section
   each), `docs/LOCAL-MODELS.md` (round 6). Manual verification on the
   build host: `halo --offline -p
   "reply with the single word pong" --model ol:qwen3-coder:30b` (loopback,
   succeeds) and the same with `--model or:<any>` (refuses with the plain
   sentence).
9. **`oai:` -- the real OpenAI API, chat completions and a new Responses
   dialect** (round 5i part 1, `docs/harness/OPENAI-RESEARCH.md`):
   `oai:<model>` (group "OpenAI API (key)") against `https://
   api.openai.com/v1`, `OPENAI_API_KEY` auto-enabling it the same way
   every other single-key provider does; `BRIDGE_OPENAI_BASE_URL`/
   `HALO_OPENAI_BASE_URL` overrides the base URL for tests. Chat
   completions (the default) reuses the existing OpenAI-family compat
   profile unchanged; a NEW `openai-responses` dialect (`POST /v1/
   responses`: `instructions` for the system prompt, `input` items
   including `function_call`/`function_call_output` for tool use, tools
   as flat function items, `reasoning: {effort}`, `store: false` and
   NEVER `previous_response_id` -- Halo always keeps owning the
   transcript) is wired into the same three dialect-dispatch points the
   `ollama` dialect uses, plus the small-model and compaction paths,
   selected per model by an exact-id table (`gpt-6-astra`, `gpt-6.1-sol`
   -- exactly the two ids the Responses API reference names as requiring
   it for function calling, confirmed live 2026-10-04; similarly-named
   ids the same page does not name are deliberately left on chat
   completions) and `openai.dialect_overrides` config, either direction.
   Reasoning is carried for display only, never replayed on the wire
   (the documented scope cut: `store:false` rules out
   `previous_response_id`, and encrypted-reasoning-content replay is not
   implemented this round). `GET /v1/models` cached in its own state
   file with a TTL (no price/context on this endpoint, confirmed live --
   those come from a new vendored models.dev `openai` fallback, 53 ids);
   error shapes (401, 429 `insufficient_quota`, 404) need no new mapping
   code at all -- the existing OpenAI-shaped error path already produces
   the real plain sentences, pinned with new tests instead. `/providers`
   says plainly that the OpenAI API has no public balance endpoint for
   ordinary keys and shows computed spend instead; the init wizard gets
   an "OpenAI API (key)" tab (same pattern as Hugging Face's). **No
   OpenAI key exists on the build host -- every behaviour above is
   verified against the parameterized `tests/helpers/mock_openai.py`
   fake only, including a live Read-tool round trip on the Responses
   dialect; unverified against the real API until a key is available.**
   Docs: `docs/MODELS.md` ("OpenAI API" section + the ref-form table),
   `docs/CONFIG.md` (`OPENAI_API_KEY`, `HALO_OPENAI_BASE_URL`, `openai.
   dialect_overrides`), `docs/COMMANDS.md` (`halo doctor`/`halo
   providers`), `docs/LOCAL-MODELS.md` (round 6, marked "verified against
   the fake only until a key is available").
10. **`cx:` -- the Codex subscription route, and Codex settings/AGENTS.md
    read beside Claude Code's** (round 5i part 2, `docs/harness/
    CODEX-RESEARCH.md`): `cx:<model>` (group "Codex subscription
    (ChatGPT)") drives the installed `codex` CLI headlessly under the
    user's own ChatGPT login, mirroring the `cc:` design wherever Codex's
    architecture allows it: detection is the `codex` binary on PATH plus
    `codex login status`'s plain-text answer (never `~/.codex/auth.json`;
    only `"Logged in using ChatGPT"` counts, an API-key/Bedrock/token
    login points at `oai:` instead); short aliases `astra`/`sol`/`luna`
    for the documented ChatGPT-plan ids, reusing the `oai:` route's own
    vendored models.dev catalog for context/output (price is always
    `None` -- a subscription isn't metered). Unlike `cc:` (one held-open
    `claude` process fed one stdin line per turn), `codex exec` has no
    stdin-streaming protocol at all -- each Halo turn spawns a FRESH
    `codex exec [resume <thread-id>] --json <prompt>` subprocess and runs
    it to completion, so steering is a documented fallback (queued, sent
    as its own follow-up `resume` call the moment the current turn ends,
    repeating until nothing is queued, before one `turn_done` closes the
    whole chain) rather than a live mid-turn channel. Codex keeps its own
    native shell/apply_patch tools running in its own sandbox (no flag
    disables them the way `cc:`'s `--tools ""` does) while Halo's own
    tool catalog is ADDITIONALLY exposed through an inline `-c
    mcp_servers.halo.<field>=<value>` override at the SAME bridge `cc:`
    uses -- a native Codex action is logged read-only after the fact, a
    real `mcp_servers.halo` call is dispatched through Halo's own
    permission engine/hooks exactly like every other route's tools; the
    bridge's own token/socket address ride on the subprocess's
    environment, forwarded to the MCP child by name
    (`mcp_servers.halo.env_vars`), never spelled out on Codex's command
    line. Halo's permission mode maps onto `approval_policy`/
    `sandbox_mode`: bypass/auto -> `never`/`danger-full-access`, default
    -> `on-request`/`workspace-write`, manual -> `untrusted`/`read-only`.
    Also reads (never writes) Codex's own `config.toml` (`$CODEX_HOME`
    plus a trusted project's `.codex/config.toml`, a small hand-rolled
    reader -- this repo ships no TOML dependency) and its `AGENTS.md`
    chain (global override-or-plain, then the SAME rule from the git
    root down to cwd, 32 KiB cap -- a DIFFERENT walk than Halo's existing
    CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md loader, kept deliberately separate) into one
    merged view beside Claude Code's own settings/CLAUDE.md
    (`providers/settings_merge.py`): non-overlapping entries merge (a
    Codex-only MCP server joins the list, its AGENTS.md is its own
    block); overlapping entries follow halo's own config, then Claude
    Code, then Codex, except on a live `cx:` session where Codex's own
    model/reasoning-effort/approval-and-sandbox policy leads;
    `settings.primary: "claude"|"codex"` flips the Claude-Code-vs-Codex
    half of that order. New `/settings [primary claude|codex]` command,
    `halo doctor`'s `codex_settings` line, and the init wizard's
    "Settings sources" step all show/set the same merged view. **No one
    is logged into Codex on the build host -- every behaviour above is
    verified against the parameterized `tests/helpers/fake_codex.py`
    only, including a real MCP tool-call round trip through the bridge
    and the steer-fallback's follow-up `resume` call; unverified against
    the real CLI until a ChatGPT login is available.** Docs:
    `docs/MODELS.md` ("Codex subscription (ChatGPT)" and "Codex settings
    and instructions" sections + the ref-form/alias tables),
    `docs/CONFIG.md` (the Codex-files section, `settings.primary`),
    `docs/COMMANDS.md` (`halo models --cx`, the init wizard tabs/step),
    `docs/SLASH-COMMANDS.md` (`/settings`, the `/providers` row),
    `docs/LOCAL-MODELS.md` (round 6, marked "verified against the fake
    only until a login is available").

### Fixes from the release review

- **`/ollama`/`/local` no longer crash the TUI on first paint**: both dialogs defined a bare `_render()`, shadowing a real Textual internal that returns `None`; renamed to `_render_rows` everywhere.
- **Exit-time stop never kills another session's managed server, or a stale pid the OS reused**: the registry now records an owner pid/start time and the server's own start time, both verified before any signal is sent.
- **KV bytes/token uses the model's real per-head size when it's known**: `key_length`/`value_length` (GGUF/`/api/show`) or config.json `head_dim` now win over the `embedding_length/head_count` approximation that could overcount the fit estimate by up to 2x; `halo local serve -c` is capped by the trained context and the hard cap.
- **The context-overflow retry ceiling can no longer exceed the remote default, the fallback, or the trained context**: a successful retry is remembered for the rest of the session so it isn't repeated every turn; the `FALLBACK_NUM_CTX` placeholder is raised from 8192 to 16384 (below Halo's own measured minimum prompt cost).
- **A local host with no GPU reading gets the same conservative default a remote host gets, not the hard cap**: tightened further to 8192 on a positively CPU-only box; a recorded `does_not_fit` calibration verdict also routes to the fallback instead of being indistinguishable from "nothing known".
- **A learned calibration cap never outranks a smaller live fit estimate**: both now compete in the same `min(...)`, so a cap measured on an idle GPU can no longer force a partial offload once another workload holds some of that VRAM.
- **The constrained-tool-calls gate now recognizes every LAN Ollama host, not just loopback**: keyed on "not Ollama Cloud" (`ollama.com` hostname or an `api_key`) instead of `is_local_host`, for the repair round, `doctor --local`, and the gym.
- **Auto-calibration never blocks a turn past a budget, never runs from `call_small_model`, and never records an unreachable host as permanently "does not fit"**: the measurement now runs in a background thread bounded by the session's own abort and a total wait budget; a host that never answers is reported as "unreachable" and nothing is recorded.
- **Calibration, throughput and capability lookups match `<model>` and `<model>:latest` as one key, everywhere**: the fit-calibration store, the last-turn throughput record, the model picker's capability lookup, and `vram_aware_override`'s same-model check all go through `ollama_names_match` now instead of comparing raw strings, so a cap or throughput reading recorded under either spelling is found by the other.
- **A learned calibration cap is re-measured after a re-pull or an Ollama upgrade**: the on-disk entry's digest/version are now also checked by the auto-calibration gate (not just the live lookup), and the live lookup now checks the server version too, via a per-process-cached `/api/version` probe that costs no extra request after the first turn on a host; a mismatch on either is treated as "no cap at all" instead of a stale measurement standing forever.
- **A bare `hf:local/<model>` resolves to the server that actually serves it**: the managed-server registry (confirmed alive by probing it) and any auto-detected server are checked for an exact match on the model id before ever falling back to "the default server" (previously: whichever server auto-detected first, or started most recently, regardless of what it actually served); a one-line notice names which server was chosen.
- **The managed llama-server now starts with `--alias <model id>`**: its own `/v1/models` id equals the Halo-side name instead of the `-m` file path, so context readback and the model-id resolution above both actually match it; the `/props` single-model-context fallback now only ever applies to a server reporting exactly one model, never broadcast across several.
- **`halo local serve -c` capping verified against the full finding**: already correct as of A-1 (`min(fit_or_trained, trained_context, HARD_CONTEXT_CAP)`); the pinning tests now also cover the hard-cap-wins and nothing-known cases the first pass left unexercised.
- **A partially-offloaded real turn now leaves a trace**: the panel (and `halo ollama`/`halo doctor`, which render through the same function) names `ollama.hosts[].max_ctx` directly beside a learned cap; a real turn that loads offloaded (auto-calibration off, a stale cap, a does-not-fit record, or a retry past the ceiling all reach this) now also records a learned cap from the turn's own `/api/ps` reading and queues the one-sentence notice.
- **A managed server's own readiness wait no longer kills a model that is still downloading or loading**: the budget now scales with the model's own size instead of a fixed 10s (the exact bug that killed `hf:mlx`'s first-use download on every attempt); a child that exits early surfaces its own stderr instead of a generic timeout sentence.
- **`think` is sent only to a model that declares the `thinking` capability, and only when this session's own effort was explicitly set**: a carried `last_effort` from an earlier session, or settings.json's `effortLevel`, no longer turns thinking on by itself (Ollama 400s "does not support thinking" for a model that never declared it); `none`/`minimal` now map to off (gpt-oss: its own lowest graded level) instead of silently mapping to on.
- **Sub-agents resolve their own credentials** (review B1): a child on a
  different route than its parent (an `ol:` or `hf:local` child under an
  `or:` parent, an `oai:` child anywhere) resolves creds for its own model and
  never inherits the parent's key, base URL or custom headers; a child whose
  provider is not configured returns that provider's own "not configured"
  sentence as the tool result instead of sending anything.
- **`/model` never keeps the previous model's credentials** (B2): a switch to
  a ref whose provider is not configured is refused with the provider's own
  sentence (an `hf:mlx/` ref starts its managed server first), and a session
  switch clears stale creds rather than reusing them.
- **`cx:` turns after the first work again** (B3): the sandbox rides as
  `-c sandbox_mode=<mode>` on both `codex exec` and `codex exec resume` (the
  latter has no `-s`), and the fake codex now rejects unknown resume flags the
  way the real one does.
- **The `cx:` prompt travels on stdin** (B4): never on argv, so quoting,
  `%VAR%` expansion and the command-line length limit no longer apply; on
  Windows the npm `.cmd` shim is bypassed in favour of `node <codex.js>` when
  it sits beside the shim.
- **Responses function tools are sent with `strict: false`** (B5), and the
  mock gateway now enforces the strict-schema rules so a regression is caught.
- **`oai:` chat completions have their own profile** (B6):
  `max_completion_tokens`, `stream_options.include_usage`, and
  `reasoning_effort` only on rows the vendored catalog marks as reasoning,
  clamped to the effort values that row lists.
- **Offline mode's allow-list only accepts an actually-local host** (C1): a
  configured `ollama.hosts`/`huggingface.local_servers` entry is allow-listed
  only when its URL is a private/loopback/link-local/ULA IP literal, a bare
  single-label or `.local` name, or the entry carries an explicit
  `offline_ok: true`; `ollama.com` (configured directly, or via an ambient
  `OLLAMA_HOST`) and any other public hostname are now refused under
  `--offline`/`/offline on` with the same plain sentence as any other cloud
  host.
- **A loopback or allow-listed host is never sent through a configured
  proxy** (C2): `HTTPS_PROXY`/`HTTP_PROXY` used to apply even to
  `127.0.0.1` or a LAN Ollama host with nothing exempting them; `open_
  upstream` also re-checks offline mode against the proxy host itself
  before connecting, in case a future change to proxy selection ever lets
  one through again.
- **Every network path now consults `network.offline` before starting**
  (C3): the update check's `git ls-remote`, every `cc:`/`cx:` turn (and
  their one-shot small/judge/title calls), `halo models --cx --refresh`'s
  codex pings, `--plugin-url`'s `git clone`, and `hf:mlx`'s model download
  all skip or refuse with the same plain sentence instead of reaching the
  network while offline; `halo update`'s apply step returns an error result
  instead of running the reinstall command.
- **`ollama.hosts[].api_key`/`huggingface.endpoints[].token`/`huggingface.
  local_servers[].api_key` are no longer stored as plaintext** (C16): a
  saved key now lives in the same shared env file `DATABRICKS_TOKEN`/
  `HF_TOKEN` already use, under a generated name; config.json keeps only
  the reference (`api_key_env`/`token_env`). An existing plaintext value
  still resolves and is migrated to the env file the next time that entry
  is saved; `~/.halo/config.json` is written 0600 on POSIX, and `halo
  config list`/`config get` mask secret-shaped values instead of printing
  them verbatim.
- **Malformed `ollama.hosts`/`huggingface.endpoints`/`huggingface.
  local_servers` entries are logged by name only** (C17): the debug line
  used to log `%r` of the whole entry, key or token included; the shared
  redactor in `redact.py` now also matches a Python-repr single-quoted
  assignment (`'token': '...'`, the shape that logging produced) and the
  `hf_...`/`xpl_...` token shapes.
- **An offline-gated request can no longer be redirected to a disallowed
  host** (C21): `urlopen_tls` only ever checked the first URL; a redirect
  handler now re-runs the same offline check on every hop before following
  it.
- **Hybrid escalation never switches onto a target offline mode would
  itself refuse** (C4): with `network.offline`/`--offline` on, a trigger
  whose `to` resolves to a host the offline allow-list would refuse now
  stays local, logs one line at DEBUG, and shows a plain "held: offline"
  notice instead of silently flipping the session's primary model to one
  every later request would then also be refused for.
- **An auto-switch leaves a real trace** (C5): the escalation card is now
  a permanent transcript line (`system_note`, never just a 5-second toast),
  the status bar's model chip updates immediately instead of waiting for
  whatever the next turn happens to emit, and print mode carries the
  switch in the `-p --output-format json` result's new `escalations`
  field.
- **`tool_failures` only counts real tool errors** (C6): a permission
  denial (an interactive "No", a deny rule, a PreToolUse hook block) or an
  interrupted call no longer counts toward the `>= 2` threshold on its
  own; a schema/repair rejection still does.
- **A role's own `escalation: false` now actually takes effect** (C7):
  `_normalize_role_value`/`configured_role_table()` used to silently drop
  the `escalation` key down to `{model[, effort]}` only, so the per-role
  override (config.json, team.json, or a loaded template) could never
  reach `role_escalation_enabled`; it now survives normalization end to
  end.
- **"Saved versus cloud" stops accruing the instant a session leaves
  local** (C8): `add_savings` is now gated on the CURRENT model being
  local, resolved fresh on every call, instead of only on whether a
  reference price was ever pinned at session start -- an escalation or a
  `/model`/`--fallback-model` switch to a cloud ref stops the figure
  growing immediately, and it resumes with no re-pinning once back on a
  local model.
- **The TUI's "saved $x" chip actually shows up now** (C9):
  `message_end`'s own `saved_usd` field reaches the real `StatusBar`
  through `tui/dispatch.py` for the first time; `Session.status_event()`
  carries it on every status too, not just message_end.
- **A status event without a throughput reading no longer blanks the
  chip** (C10): the three `ollama_*` fields now ride on `events.status()`
  only when the producer actually passes them, the same "presence means a
  reading" rule the MCP count already follows -- an ordinary turn-start/
  turn-end status elsewhere in the loop no longer wipes the "NN tok/s"
  segment back to blank.
- **`/model` can finally pick a local model** (C11):
  `Controller.list_models()` now lists an `Ollama (<host>)` group per
  configured host and `hf:local/*`/`hf:mlx/*` groups for every registered
  local server and `huggingface.model_dirs` file, reusing the exact same
  shared discovery `/local` already uses.
- **The picker's `u` key works from where the cursor actually starts**
  (C12): focus begins on the filter box, which used to swallow a bare "u"
  as text before any binding ever saw it (Textual strips a key the
  focused widget claims from every ancestor's bindings before `priority`
  is even consulted); the filter now forwards it to the role-assignment
  action directly, which reads the ref off the highlighted OptionList row
  instead of the filtered list's same-index entry -- the two could
  disagree the moment a disabled group header sat above it.
- **The VRAM-aware role redirect now applies to real sub-agent spawns,
  not just `/roles`'s own display** (C13): `resolve_agent_model` -- the
  function that actually picks the model for Explore/Researcher, Judge,
  and an unnamed sub-agent -- now runs the same `vram_aware_override`
  check `/roles`/`halo roles`/the escalation judge already use, for a
  table value only, never a CLI `--role` override.
- **`/local add`/`/local forget` work in the TUI** (C14): they used to
  fall straight through to the "answer it as a question" branch and
  persist nothing; now routed through the same `_cmd_local`/
  `add_model_dir`/`forget_model_dir` print mode already uses.
- **Saving the wizard's Ollama tab with every field blank no longer
  overwrites a configured host** (C15): the documented "leave every field
  blank to register the local daemon" flow is now a no-op once any host
  already exists, and a non-blank save MERGES into a same-named entry's
  existing fields (`default`/`max_ctx`/`kv_cache_type`/`ssh`/`keep_alive`)
  instead of replacing it outright.
- **The MCP count never shows a fake "0 connected"** (owner report):
  `Session.status_event`/`Controller._mcp_status` now return no reading at
  all -- rather than `{"connected": 0, "total": 0}` -- when no
  `mcp_status_fn` was ever wired or it failed, so the status bar keeps its
  last real count instead of flashing an empty one; a lazily-cached MCP
  server's first real connect now publishes a fresh status event right
  away, instead of waiting for whatever the next turn happens to emit.
- **The whole gpt-6 and gpt-5.6 families use the Responses dialect** (B7):
  not only `gpt-6-astra`/`gpt-6.1-sol` -- `gpt-6-sol`, `gpt-6-luna`,
  `gpt-5.6`, `gpt-5.6-sol`, `gpt-5.6-luna` and `gpt-5.6-terra` now default to
  `openai-responses` too, so a tool-bearing turn never pays the live-verified
  "Function tools with reasoning_effort are not supported" 400 and its
  retry; the `oai:` chat profile also sets `reasoning_effort_with_tools`
  for the same families (the way the Databricks branch already did), so an
  `openai.dialect_overrides` entry that forces one of them back onto chat
  still sends `reasoning_effort: "none"` on the first request.
- **A compactionModel/small-model override on the SAME provider but a
  different host or key now resolves its own credentials** (B8): the swap
  used to re-resolve creds only when `ref.provider` itself differed, so an
  `ol:small@lan` compactionModel under an `ol:big` (default host) main
  session inherited the main host's creds; both call sites now resolve the
  override ref unconditionally and skip the override entirely (falling back
  to the session's own main model, never the main model's creds under the
  override's body) when nothing resolves.
- **`HALO_OPENROUTER_BASE_URL`/`BRIDGE_OPENROUTER_BASE_URL` never leaks onto
  a non-`or:` request** (B9): the session-level override used to apply to
  every non-Databricks chat route it was still SET for -- an `oai:`/`hf:`
  request built after a `/model` switch, a fallback, an escalation, or a
  sub-agent/small/compaction call away from an `or:` leg of the same session
  went to the OpenRouter override URL with the OpenAI/HF key instead of its
  own provider's real endpoint; `providers/stream.py`'s phase 1 now applies
  it only when the request's own route is actually `openrouter`.
- **`extra_headers` are rebuilt for the route of EACH request** (B10):
  Databricks's `ANTHROPIC_CUSTOM_HEADERS` and the hf: router's
  `X-HF-Bill-To` used to be computed once from the session's STARTING
  model and handed to every later request verbatim -- a `/model` switch,
  a fallback, or a small/compaction-model override onto a different
  provider kept sending them to OpenRouter/Ollama/local servers, and
  switching INTO `dbx:`/the router never gained its own header. Both are
  now recomputed from the actual route of every outgoing request.
- **The Codex approval/sandbox table is keyed on the engine's own six real
  permission modes** (B11): `default|acceptEdits|plan|auto|dontAsk|
  bypassPermissions`, not the pre-engine-name `bypass`/`manual` strings
  `normalize_permission_mode` never actually produces -- every mode but
  `auto` used to fall through to the `default` row by accident, including
  `bypassPermissions`/`dontAsk`/`acceptEdits`/`plan`; each now has its own
  documented `approval_policy`/`sandbox_mode` pair (`plan` is `never`/
  `read-only`, so it never writes at all), matching docs/MODELS.md.
- **A `cx:` prompt is never truncated, confirmed with a dedicated test**
  (B12): B-1's stdin-delivery fix already removed the old "first 20,000
  characters" argv cap along with the argv-embedded prompt itself, but
  nothing pinned the scenario that used to lose the user's own message --
  a 60,000-character carried context (switching INTO `cx:` mid-session)
  plus a short next message now has a test proving the user's text still
  arrives intact at the end of the delivered prompt.
- **`--effort`/`/effort` now reaches `codex exec`** (B13): `cc:` already
  forwarded it, `cx:` silently dropped it -- the status bar and `/effort`
  showed a level Codex never actually received, running on whatever
  `config.toml` said instead. Now rides as its own
  `-c model_reasoning_effort=<value>` on every invocation (a fresh `exec`
  and a `resume` alike), mapped from Halo's harness-wide effort levels
  (which share five of Codex's own six names outright); omitted entirely
  when no effort is set.
- **A `codex` one-shot call that times out no longer leaves anything
  running** (B14): the one-shot `cx:` small-model call, the synchronous
  `codex login status` preflight on a session's first turn, `halo models
  --cx --refresh`'s per-alias pings and the `--version` check all spawned
  the binary with a plain `subprocess.run(..., timeout=...)`, whose own
  timeout only reaches the ONE resolved process -- on Windows that is
  often an npm `.cmd` shim or a `node` launcher, never the real work
  beneath it, so `communicate()` kept blocking on a still-running
  grandchild past the timeout (verified: an 8s child outlived a 2s
  timeout by 6.1s). A shared bounded-subprocess helper now isolates each
  call in its own process group with `stdin=DEVNULL` and kills the WHOLE
  tree on a timeout (`taskkill /T /F` on Windows, `killpg` on POSIX),
  draining any buffered output so nothing is left as a zombie.
- **No 2.0.3 provider secret reaches a tool child's environment** (B15):
  the fixed strip list named only pre-2.0.3 keys, so `HF_TOKEN`,
  `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `OLLAMA_API_KEY` and the Experiential Labs keys
  reached every Bash/PowerShell/MCP/hook child, from the shell or a
  settings env, unlike `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`/`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`; the
  `cx:` route's own child env now also strips `OPENAI_*`/`CODEX_API_KEY`
  (Codex's own documented API-key billing path) the way it already strips
  `ANTHROPIC_*`/`CLAUDE*`, so a `cx:` session can no longer silently bill
  a key instead of running on the ChatGPT subscription.
- **`/models refresh`, `halo models --refresh` and the background catalog
  worker now refresh the OpenAI catalog too** (B16): `refresh_openai_
  catalog_if_stale` had no caller anywhere -- a key from the shell or env
  file (never run through the init wizard's own OpenAI tab, the only
  other writer of `openai-models.json`) never got a picker group, and an
  init-written cache was never refreshed again. Wired into the same four
  surfaces OpenRouter/Anthropic/Databricks already use: the TUI's launch
  and `/model`-open background worker, the TUI's `/models [refresh]`
  command, and the headless `/models`/`halo models --refresh` commands.
- **Offline mode for `cc:`/`cx:` turns, confirmed covered on both turn
  paths** (B17): C-1 already added the gate (`_preflight_cc`/
  `_preflight_cx`, both one-shot small/judge/title calls, and `halo
  models --cx --refresh`'s pings) and docs/CONFIG.md already describes
  it; the two tests pinning the `cx:` one-shot call and catalog refresh
  were repaired to stub the new bounded-subprocess helper (B14) instead
  of the `subprocess.run` call it replaced, so both turn paths stay
  genuinely covered rather than silently passing on a stub nothing
  reaches any more.
- **No more "MAXIMUM STEPS REACHED" at 50 tool calls** (rolo, 2026-10-05):
  `--max-turns` defaulted to 50 and the TUI applied it to interactive
  sessions, so any long task stopped mid-stream with a handoff summary.
  Claude Code only caps print mode and only when asked; Halo now matches:
  no cap anywhere unless `--max-turns N` is passed (a non-positive value
  also means no cap). The identical-call breaker and the cost/context
  meters remain the runaway guards.
- **`/ollama` and `/local` refresh results arriving after the dialog is gone
  are dropped, never raised**: a refresh worker whose dialog was dismissed
  (or whose app was already exiting) used to raise NoActiveAppError out of
  the worker; both dialogs now hand results to the UI thread through a
  guard that ignores that case.

## [2.0.2] - 2026-10-04

W7 rounds 1-7 of the 2.0.2 brief (F, A, B, C, D, E, then the init wizard):
the terminal tab title fix, roles v2, organizations, sub-agent visibility
and scale, MCP repair actions, Qwen tool calling at work, `halo update`,
and one init wizard with Back/Skip/Next buttons plus Roles/Organizations
setup screens.

1. **Terminal tab title stays `halo`**: root cause confirmed by reading
   every `claude`-spawning call site -- each one pipes the child's stdout/
   stderr for its own parsing but never detaches it from the shared
   console/tty, and a real `claude` binary sets the console/terminal title
   itself at startup through a side channel independent of those redirected
   handles (Windows: the console title is a property of the console object
   any attached process can set, regardless of its own stdout; POSIX: an
   OSC 2 write most terminals honour however it arrives) and never restores
   it -- while Textual's own `BridgeApp.TITLE` has never touched the real
   terminal at all (it's only ever the in-app Header widget's text).
   `halo_harness.termtitle` (new) re-asserts `halo` via OSC 2 plus, on
   Windows, a `SetConsoleTitleW` fallback for legacy `conhost`: at TUI
   start and on `/resume`, after every `claude` child exits
   (`agent/cc_process.py`, `providers/cc_models.py`'s probes, `mcp/
   connectors.py`'s discovery), and once more on the drain tick that
   follows one, as insurance. Print mode (`-p`) saves whatever title was
   there at start and restores it at exit; the OSC 2 write itself is
   skipped on a non-interactive default stdout (never spliced into a
   `--output-format json/stream-json` consumer's own piped output).
2. **Roles v2**: `ROLE_NAMES` grows from five to ten -- `planner` (the
   `Plan` agent's own role now, moved off `reviewer`), `judge` and `tester`
   (two new built-in agents with matching roles), `compaction` (a rung
   between `compactionModel` and the session's main model), and
   `subagent_default` (the last rung before the session model, for a
   sub-agent with no role at all). A role's table value may now be
   `{"model", "effort"}` instead of a bare string, applied through the same
   path the session's own effort takes; `/roles` and the role resolver show
   `requested (sent as X)` when a role's effort maps to a different one on
   its route. Any syntactically-valid custom role name (`[a-z][a-z0-9_]*`)
   a team.json or a loaded template defines is now a valid role everywhere
   a built-in one is -- `--role NAME=MODEL[:EFFORT]`, `/role <name> <model>
   [effort]` (new) and `/roles set` all validate against the live set of
   known names. TUI tab completion for `/role`/`/roles set`'s arguments
   (role name, then model ref, then effort -- ranked prefix-then-substring,
   `tui/completion.py::filter_items`) and shell completion (`halo
   completion bash|zsh|powershell`, reading the cached model catalog with
   no network call) are both new. Role TEMPLATES
   (`~/.halo/roles/<name>.json`) are a new named, reusable role table:
   `/roles templates|save|load|new|edit|show` in the TUI (`edit` opens a
   form, `tui/dialogs/roles_editor.py`, or `$EDITOR` when `roles.editor:
   "external"` is configured) and `halo roles template list|save|load|new|
   edit|show` from the CLI.
3. **Organizations**: `halo_harness/orgs.py` (new) -- a named, reusable
   TREE of sub-agent positions (`role`/`model`, `effort`, `instructions`,
   a tool allowlist, and the OTHER positions it may itself delegate to)
   saved as `~/.halo/orgs/<name>.json`, with exactly one root (the title
   nobody else's own `reports` names). Three built-ins ship copied in on
   first use and are never overwritten once present: `solo` (one
   orchestrator), `release-flow` (the brief -> implement -> test -> review
   -> fix -> retest -> report loop this project is itself built with --
   `Fixer` delegates back to the SAME `Tester` position `Implementer`
   delegated to earlier, a reused edge rather than a second copy), and
   `company` (CEO -> three VPs -> one manager each -> two workers each).
   Running one (`/org run <name> "<goal>"`, `Agent(org=<name>,
   prompt=<goal>)`, or `halo org run <name> "<goal>"`) turns every position
   into a real `AgentSpec` and spawns the root through the EXACT sub-agent
   machinery an ordinary `Agent` call already uses -- each position's own
   `reports` becomes its `agent_type_restriction` (a call outside it is
   refused with a clear tool error, the same check a `tools:
   ["Agent(name)"]`-restricted agent file already enforced, now actually
   reaching a child for the first time), depth comes from the org's own
   tree shape instead of the usual depth-1 cap, and concurrency is the new
   `agents.max_concurrent` config knob (default 4, applies to every
   session now, org or not) unless the org sets its own. The dock shows a
   running position as `<title> (<role>)` instead of the bare title
   (`AgentSpec.dock_label`). `/org list|show|new|load|edit|run` in the TUI
   (`edit` opens a tree-view-left/fields-right form, `tui/dialogs/
   org_editor.py`; `load` re-installs a built-in over a local copy) and
   `halo org list|show|new|edit|run` from the CLI. See
   [docs/ORGS.md](docs/ORGS.md).
4. **Sub-agent visibility and scale**: `/tasks`/Ctrl+T (new, `tui/dialogs/
   tasks.py`) -- a full-height panel listing every running, queued,
   background and finished sub-agent (and background job) of this
   session, an org run's own descendants indented under their parent;
   Enter opens a live, follow-mode transcript viewer of that agent's own
   log (`PgUp`/`PgDn` scroll, `o` the full pager); a second tab shows the
   new shared task board. The status bar shows `agents N` (running
   count) when N > 0. `agents.max_depth` (config, default 1, up to 3; an
   org's own tree shape overrides it, unclamped) joins `agents.max_
   concurrent` as a real config knob instead of a hard-coded constant.
   The Agent tool gains `count` (N identical copies of `prompt`) and
   `batch` (a list of `{prompt, role?, model?, effort?}` objects) --
   spawns several sub-agents in one call, capped at `agents.max_
   concurrent` (excess ones queue, announced to the panel immediately via
   a new `subagent_queued` event, and start as slots free); the parent
   waits on all of them and gets back one combined result, one
   `<task_result>` section per child, in spawn order. A new shared task
   board (`TaskCreate`/`TaskUpdate`/`TaskList` tools, `~/.halo/sessions/
   <id>/tasks.json`) lets every sub-agent of a session -- an
   organization's workers, most usefully -- claim and report on open
   work; claiming an already-claimed task is refused, never a lost
   update. Two `/org run` gaps closed on the way: its own result used to
   land in the transcript as a raw `<task_result task_id="...">` block
   with no live progress at all (it now streams through the same live
   sub-agent machinery an `Agent(org=...)` tool call already uses, so the
   root position -- and everything it delegates to -- gets a real card
   with its own position title, and the final text is unwrapped before
   display); and an org run's own spend, though it was already rolling
   into the session's cost meter correctly, never reached the status bar
   (nothing re-reads it once a slash command finishes outside the normal
   turn loop) -- it now pushes a fresh status refresh once the run
   completes. See [docs/SUBAGENTS.md](docs/SUBAGENTS.md).
5. **MCP repair actions**: `/mcp` gains a key legend plus the rest of the
   repair surface -- `R` reconnect every server, `l` login (the 2.0.1
   OAuth flow for a local `http`/`sse` server, or the claude.ai connector
   re-auth pointer), `L` a tail of `~/.halo/mcp/<server>.log` (stdio
   stderr PLUS connect/transport errors, both appended to the one file
   now, rotated at 1 MB instead of 5), `e` edit the entry at its own line
   in `$EDITOR`, or an inline form with no `$EDITOR` set (`tui/dialogs/
   mcp_entry_form.py`, new), `i` an install hint for a command-not-found
   server guessed from the missing command (`npx`/`node`/`uvx`/`uv`/
   `pipx`/`pip`/`python`), `d` disable/enable per directory (Claude
   Code's own `disabledMcpServers`), and `t` a timed `tools/list` round
   trip. Every failed/needs_auth/pending_approval/disabled row carries
   its reason and one fix line (`mcp_cli.fix_line_for`, shared code --
   `halo mcp fix <name> [--apply]` prints and, with `--apply`, runs the
   exact same diagnosis from the CLI; `halo mcp test <name>` is `t` from
   the CLI). A server that dies mid-session reconnects on its next use
   with backoff (1, 2, 4, 8s, then every 30s, giving up after 10 minutes)
   instead of retrying on every single call; the row shows the attempt
   count and next retry, and a manual `r`/`R`/`--apply` always resets it.
   `(McpManager.reconnect_manual`/`McpServerHandle` backoff fields, `mcp/
   manager.py`.) Fixed along the way: approving a pending `.mcp.json`
   server from `halo mcp fix --apply` left the live handle's own stale
   `pending_approval` flag set, so the reconnect that's supposed to
   follow silently no-op'd every time (the TUI's own `a` action already
   cleared it; this CLI path now does too). See the `/mcp` section and
   `halo mcp fix`/`test` in [docs/COMMANDS.md](docs/COMMANDS.md), and the
   "a server shows failed" walkthrough in
   [docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md). Two round D fixes
   on the way out: `e`'s external-editor launch no longer passes vim's
   own `+<line>` argument to every `$EDITOR` -- `code`/`subl` get their
   own line syntax now (`--goto file:line`/`file:line`), anything else
   opens the file plain; `halo mcp learned [--forget <endpoint>]` lists
   (or clears, before its TTL) a learned per-endpoint provider rule
   (`providers/learned_rules.py`, round 5's own "tools_rejected" cache).
6. **Qwen tool calling at work**: the owner's work-VM "openjev qwen"
   report traced to `databricks-openjev-qwen35-4b`, Databricks' own
   decision-only "evaluates yes/no, choice, and scoring questions"
   endpoint -- never a chat/tool-calling model. Classified from DATA
   (`model_table.json`'s top-level `decision_only_name_patterns` substring
   net, plus the row's own `capabilities.decision_only`), never a
   hardcoded id check: the `/model` picker now groups it under "Databricks
   (judge / decision)" with that one-line description, `/model`/picking it
   never installs it as the session model -- it's routed to the `judge`
   role automatically instead, with a plain notice -- and a request that
   still carries `tools` for it (or for ANY Databricks endpoint a live
   request already proved rejects tools, learned per-endpoint in
   `~/.halo/learned-rules.json`, even with no table row at all) gets one
   clear error naming the model and the judge role instead of a wire 400
   (`providers.request.ToolsNotSupported`; the live-400 twin lives in
   `agent/loop.py` via the new `providers.errors.is_tools_rejected_
   message`). Separately, two leak-repair patterns every Qwen row had
   declared since H2 but `providers/hooks.py` never implemented are now
   real: `python_repr_args` (a bare single-quoted Python-dict-literal tool
   call, no wrapper at all) and `missing_tool_call_opener` (Qwen3-Coder
   #475's own shape -- a `}</tool_call>` tail with no opening tag).
   `think_tag_strip` now also strips a bare leading `</think>` with no
   opener (Qwen3-235B-Thinking-2507/QwQ's documented replay shape), and
   `providers/request.py`'s Databricks schema simplifier now rewrites a
   forbidden `prefixItems` keyword to `items` plus a `description` note
   instead of leaving it on the wire (the 16-key cap was already enforced
   by the time this round started -- the research doc's claim otherwise
   was stale, not a live defect). See
   [docs/harness/QWEN-RESEARCH.md](docs/harness/QWEN-RESEARCH.md),
   [docs/harness/FAMILY-BASELINE-qwen.md](docs/harness/FAMILY-BASELINE-qwen.md)
   and the new "Qwen at work" section in
   [docs/MODELS.md](docs/MODELS.md). Still unconfirmed until the owner
   sends a real `halo bugreport`: the exact endpoint/HTTP body, whether a
   400 or a silently-ignored 200 is what it actually returns for a
   tool-bearing call, and whether `tools` were present on the first
   failing turn or a later one.

7. **`halo update` and `/update`**: `halo_harness/update.py` (new) knows
   what's installed (PEP 610 `direct_url.json` -- commit and requested
   revision for a git install, `git rev-parse`/`git branch` in the
   checkout for an editable install or a bare PYTHONPATH run) and what's
   available upstream (`git ls-remote` against GitHub, or the REST API
   with no git on PATH; cached 24h in `~/.halo/update-check.json`,
   honouring `update.check: false` and `BRIDGE_TEST_NO_BACKGROUND_NET`).
   `halo --version` now prints `halo 2.0.2 (c93480d, master)` once the
   commit is known; `halo doctor` gains an "install" line naming how,
   from where, and which commit. `halo update --check` reports installed
   vs. available, the commits between them, and the exact reinstall
   command, exiting 0/10/1 (up to date/available/unknown); `halo update`
   (apply, `update_cli.py`) refuses while another halo process looks like
   it's running on this machine (excluding itself) unless `--force` --
   a reinstall under a running TUI has broken the install on Windows
   before -- then runs the command live and reports the before/after
   commit from a fresh `halo --version`. `/update` in the TUI runs the
   same check on a worker and opens a dialog with `Enter: update and
   restart halo` / `Esc: not now`; Enter exits the TUI with a sentinel
   return code, and `cli.main` -- only now past the TUI, which has
   already torn down -- runs the update with its output visible and
   relaunches with `--continue`, the only safe order on Windows (quit,
   then update, then relaunch). A cached "update available" note shows
   once a day at TUI startup, off with `update.check`/`update.notify:
   false`. `scripts/install-halo.ps1` (new) mirrors `install-halo.sh` for
   Windows PowerShell. README/docs/INSTALL.md gain matching Install and
   Update sections; docs/INSTALL.md also gains an Uninstall section.
8. **One init wizard, Roles/Organizations setup screens**: owner report
   -- "I have to press esc then it exits then brings up the next
   section ... there should be a button you select to move it forward
   ... there should be an init step that lets you set up roles first too
   or skip for later ... a setup screen should pop up to set those
   features up in addition to doing it within halo ... selection of
   templates would be good". `tui/dialogs/init_wizard.py` (new): ONE
   Textual app for the whole interactive `halo init`, `Step N of M: <name>`
   header, `Back`/`Skip`/`Next` (`Finish` on the last step) footer, Esc
   asking "Quit setup? What you saved so far stays" instead of ending
   silently -- Providers (the existing tabs content, moved in), Default
   model, Permission mode, **Theme** (new: the six built-in themes, a
   live preview), **Roles** (new: a `roles.enabled` switch, default on,
   three shipped presets -- `balanced`/`quality`/`local-first` -- with a
   preview, `Edit roles...` opening the round-1 form inline), **Organizations**
   (new: an `orgs.enabled` switch, default off, a default-org pick,
   `Edit org...` opening the round-2 form inline), Linux fixes (skipped
   automatically when nothing needs fixing), Summary. Both modes gate
   discoverability only (`/roles`/`/role`/`/org` hidden from `/help`/
   completion/the rotating tips, the `/tasks` board tab, and the `Agent`
   tool's own `org=` parameter while off) -- never a functional gate; an
   org/role invoked by name still works either way. `halo setup
   [roles|orgs]` (new `setup_cli.py`) and `/setup [roles|orgs]` (`tui/
   slash.py`) reopen the Roles/Organizations screens later -- a bare
   `halo setup`/`/setup` chains roles -> orgs -> a short summary; with no
   TTY, `halo setup` prints the current roles table/orgs list and exits
   0. The round-1 roles editor and round-2 org editor both gain a "start
   from a template" picker at their top (roles also gains `Save as
   template...`). Paperclip-derived additions to organizations (brief
   3b): **budgets** (`budget_usd` on an org and/or a position, enforced
   through the existing cost meter -- a hard stop refuses a FURTHER
   delegation once reached, a warning at 80%; the call already running
   always finishes) and **goals** (`/org run`'s own goal becomes a root
   task, `kind: "goal"`, on the shared board before the root position
   runs; every position is told to link its own tasks to it via
   `TaskCreate`'s new `parent`). `orgs.default` (`/org run`/`halo org
   run` with no name) is new too. The rest of brief 3b lands this round
   too: `halo org install <name> [--force]`/`/org install` copies a
   shipped built-in or a template saved under `~/.halo/org-templates/`
   into `~/.halo/orgs/`, refusing to overwrite without `--force` -- each
   shipped template's own `description` IS its one-line README, shown by
   `/org list`/`halo org list` (which now prints it) and the wizard's
   Organizations step (already did, via the tree preview). **Approval
   gates**: a position with `requires_approval: true` holds its just-
   finished result as a pending card in the SAME dock a permission/
   question/plan-review ask already uses (accept, edit the instruction
   and re-run -- recurses through the ordinary spawn path, capped at 5
   revisions -- or stop); with no live dock reachable (`halo org run`/
   `resume` from a plain terminal) it prints the result and waits on
   stdin instead, the same one-line-read convention `halo init`'s own
   non-interactive prompts use; `--yes` on `run`/`resume`, or the
   session's own `dontAsk` permission mode, accepts every gate
   automatically -- the OPPOSITE of `dontAsk`'s usual "ask converts to
   deny" rule, since a gate is never a tool-permission ask.
   **Export/import**: `halo org export <name> [file]` / `import <file>`
   move an org as plain JSON (import validates role names, reports and
   budgets, listing every problem); `halo roles template export|import`
   is the same pair for role templates. **`/org resume`** (and `halo org
   resume <session-id>`) continues an interrupted run from a session's
   own saved run record (`<session_dir>/org-run.json`, written when the
   run starts) and shared task board -- open and claimed tasks become
   the new root position's own work list, done tasks are named and kept
   (never redone); the resumed run's own `max_concurrent`/`budget_usd`
   come from that saved record, not whatever the org definition
   currently says, so an edit made after the original run started can
   never change what the resumed run is bound by.
9. **Release review, two fix rounds**: an Opus review of the whole
   `v2.0.1..` diff found 3 critical, 15 major and 21 minor defects, each
   with a check for whether it was actually confirmed by running or
   tracing the code; both fix rounds closed every one with a test that
   failed before and passed after. Round A (criticals/majors): `halo
   init`'s Default model step
   no longer saves the first catalog row when you press Next without
   picking (RolesStep's own "Next overwrites your current roles" bug,
   reintroduced by the wizard, closed the same way); a decision-only
   endpoint can no longer become the session default from the picker or
   a remembered model, and the Judge sub-agent runs tool-less against one
   instead of raising `ToolsNotSupported`. `halo update`/`/update` work
   on Windows now -- the uv launcher that stays alive as this process's
   own parent is no longer mistaken for another session, and an
   editable/checkout install's `git pull` + reinstall runs in the
   checkout, never whatever directory you happened to be sitting in.
   `/org run` and a resumed org task no longer take the TUI down on an
   unresolvable model, org budgets are enforced against a real per-org
   total instead of a baseline that never moved, a delegating org's
   nested sub-agent cards keep their own identity instead of all ticking
   under the root's, org depth is relative to the caller's own depth, and
   the per-call concurrency cap became one session-wide (or org-wide)
   gate so two fan-out calls in the same turn -- or a nested one -- can
   no longer double the configured cap. MCP repair: OAuth login from
   `/mcp` can be cancelled and the dialog dismissed while it waits, the
   inline entry form's args field accepts spaces and several lines
   without splitting them, and `R` skips a server you disabled. The
   `/tasks` panel refreshes on a worker thread with a cached parse per
   log file instead of re-reading every agent log on the UI thread every
   second. Roles: the `small` role is actually consulted now, and
   `roles.enabled`/`roles.editor` stop being misread as role names.
   Round B (the minors): the `/mcp` dialog re-reads each server's real
   state from the Controller after an action instead of guessing it from
   the result text (a failed `t` no longer flips a row to "connected");
   `/tasks`' transcript viewer keeps your scroll position while the log
   keeps growing, and its own board tab is reachable with `orgs.enabled`
   off too, since the board itself always worked. `count`/`batch` apply
   the call's own `effort`, reject an unknown `role` by name (listing the
   known ones, the same as an unknown `subagent_type` already did) on
   every surface (single spawn, fan-out, resume), and their combined
   result is capped and spilled to disk like every other tool's instead
   of returning megabytes raw. `/role`/`/roles set` now land where the
   model-resolution chain actually treats as winning over an agent file's
   own `model:`, with the model and effort validated; its own effort
   completion reads the model you actually typed, not the role name or
   the literal word "set". An org run's sub-agents list parent-before-
   children instead of by whatever order their random ids sorted into,
   and the tasks panel restores your highlighted row by id, not index.
   The `balanced`/`quality`/`local-first` presets skip a free/negative-
   priced or tool-less catalog entry instead of picking OpenRouter's own
   router alias as "the cheapest model". An org's root position is
   visible to the tasks panel's live cost/phase lookup now (it used to
   get its own disconnected bookkeeping). `halo update`'s relaunch on
   Windows waits for a real child process instead of exiting this one
   outright and racing the console with it. The real terminal title is
   written through Textual's own output thread while the TUI runs
   instead of racing its frames directly on `stdout`. A learned "this
   endpoint rejects tool calls" rule now expires after a day instead of
   needing a hand edit to `learned-rules.json` to undo. The `Agent` tool's
   own description lists the live, configured role names instead of a
   stale fixed five, and no longer claims a sub-agent can never delegate
   further (true only at the default depth). The shared task board
   survives an interrupted write (atomic replace) and keeps a corrupted
   one aside instead of silently replacing it with a single fresh task.
   A long tool-less Qwen answer no longer costs seconds in a leak-
   pattern regex. `halo org edit`/`halo roles template edit` no longer
   crash with a bare traceback when `$EDITOR` is multi-word (`"code
   --wait"`) or needs Windows' own PATH extension resolution. `halo
   completion` lists `update`/`org`/`setup` (missing outright before) and
   its zsh/bash scripts handle a `:`-bearing model ref correctly. The org
   editor's Ctrl+D (delete position) now reaches the screen even with a
   field focused -- Textual's own Input/TextArea binding AND an unrelated
   app-level "quit on empty/delete-right in the chat box" binding were
   both intercepting it first -- and a bare model alias typed into "Role
   or model" (`haiku`, `sonnet`) saves as a model, never a role that then
   fails validation. `/org run <name> "<goal>"` strips the quotes from
   the goal instead of sending and recording them literally.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-10-01

The rename release: `rolo-claude` 1.0.1 continues unchanged, as its own
repository; this one, Halo Harness, is where every later feature lands.
Nothing about runtime *behavior* changes here beyond the migration and
alias notices below -- every 1.0.1 fix ships exactly as it was.

1. **Product renamed to Halo Harness**: console script `halo` (`python -m
   halo_harness`); distribution `halo-harness` on PyPI (`halo` itself is a
   spinner library -- never collide); Python package `halo_harness`
   (`rolo_claude` renamed in place, every import/reference updated).
   `rolo-claude` keeps working forever as a deprecated console-script
   alias -- one notice line to stderr (`halo: 'rolo-claude' is deprecated,
   use 'halo' instead`), then runs exactly like `halo`, same process, same
   parser, including `rolo-claude proxy`. `halo proxy ...` is the renamed
   spelling of what `rolo-claude proxy`/`claude-bridge` already did
   (`bridge.py`, unchanged).
2. **State directory migration**: the default state dir is now `~/.halo`
   (was `~/.rolo-claude`). The first time anything in a fresh Halo Harness
   process resolves it, an existing `~/.rolo-claude` is renamed (never
   copied) to `~/.halo`, announced with one stderr line; every call after
   that (in this or any later process) just finds `~/.halo` already there
   and says nothing further. No link is created at the old location (`rm
   -rf ~/.rolo-claude/` with a trailing slash follows a symlink/junction
   and would empty `~/.halo` right along with it) -- a still-installed
   `rolo-claude` 1.0.1 must never be run again after this, since it would
   start from a truly empty `~/.rolo-claude`. A rename that fails (a
   locked file on Windows, a read-only/cross-device home on Linux) prints
   one warning and keeps using `~/.rolo-claude` for that run instead of
   silently losing state in a `~/.halo` that was never actually populated;
   when the rename instead loses a race to a concurrent process that
   migrates first, the `~/.halo` it left behind is adopted silently.
   `halo doctor` reports a standing WARN whenever both directories end up
   holding real data. `BRIDGE_STATE_DIR` keeps overriding the state dir
   outright, exactly as before (no migration logic runs when it's set).
   Test seams (`BRIDGE_TEST_HOME`, `BRIDGE_TEST_NO_BACKGROUND_NET`,
   `BRIDGE_TEST_CC_AUTH_STATUS`, and `BRIDGE_STATE_DIR` itself) keep their
   exact names -- no `HALO_` twin for these, by design.
3. **Env file**: `halo init` now writes `~/.config/halo/env` (was
   `~/.config/vibes-hacker/env`), copying the old file's content forward
   (directory 0700, file 0600) the first time it writes on a box where
   only the old one exists yet, so nothing already configured there is
   orphaned. The old file is never modified or renamed (other tools on
   the same box read it); the copied-forward new file starts with an
   import marker line, and once that marker is present the old file is
   no longer consulted, so a key you delete from the new file stays
   deleted. Without the marker (a hand-written new file) reading still
   checks the new file, then the old one, so a credential that only
   ever lived in the old file keeps working even before `halo init`
   runs again. `HALO_ENV_FILE` is the new override
   name; legacy `BRIDGE_ENV_FILE` keeps working (an explicit override
   always wins outright, with no blending between the two files).
4. **Env vars**: every harness-owned `BRIDGE_*`/`ROLO_CLAUDE_*` knob
   (`OPENROUTER_BASE_URL`, `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`, `DBX_BASE_URL`/
   `DBX_TOKEN`, `MODEL`/`MODEL_SMALL`, `ENV_FILE`, `CLAUDE_EXE`, `DUMP`,
   `CA_BUNDLE`, `THEME`) now has a canonical `HALO_*` name, checked first;
   the old name still works, logging one DEBUG line the first time it's
   what actually supplied the value. See `docs/CONFIG.md`'s "Every
   environment variable" table for the full list.
5. **Launch intro**: a fresh interactive launch (TUI, including
   `--continue`/`--resume`) types out `I am just a copy, of a copy, of a
   copy... halo 2.0.0` character by character above the first turn, like
   someone typing it, with a block cursor while typing; any keypress or a
   submitted prompt finishes it instantly, and the prompt input keeps
   focus throughout so nothing typed during it is ever lost. Never shown
   in print mode, a `--demo` run, or when stdout isn't a real terminal;
   `"intro": false` in `~/.halo/config.json`, or `--no-intro`, turns it
   off for good; `/intro` replays it mid-session.
6. **Compatibility odds and ends**: a project's `.rolo-claude/team.json`
   (checked into a repo before this rename) is still found, with one
   deprecation line, when `.halo/team.json` is absent. `/improve`'s
   provenance marker and the `~/.local/bin`-on-PATH rc-file marker both
   still recognize the exact text 1.0.1 wrote (a new write always uses the
   new text) -- so a file or rc-file line 1.0.1 already produced is never
   mistaken for user-authored, and `halo init` re-run on an upgraded box
   never appends a second PATH block. The `stream-json` `system/init` line's
   version field is now `halo_harness_version`; `rolo_claude_version` (same
   value) ships alongside it for a script that already reads the old name.
   The state directory itself (item 2) gets no compatibility link of its
   own, unlike these -- no link is created there, on purpose, since a
   leftover link would make `rm -rf ~/.rolo-claude/` dangerous.
7. **Docs/tests**: README/CHANGELOG/docs/briefs/guard tests all updated to
   the new names; this entry is the only CHANGELOG section written under
   them -- every entry below keeps the name it was written under.
8. **Shadow-repo long paths on Windows**: the `/rewind` git-shadow repo
   (`~/.halo/sessions/<slug>/<session_id>/shadow/`) now sets `core.
   longpaths true` right after `git init` on Windows -- the shadow repo's
   own path plus a mangled absolute source path underneath it can exceed
   Windows' 260-character limit under a long home or cwd, which git itself
   refuses without this setting.

## [2.0.1] - 2026-10-03

The "run from any directory" release: `halo` already discovered a
directory's `CLAUDE.md` chain, `.claude/rules`, settings, `.mcp.json`,
skills, commands and agents from the cwd the same way `claude` does --
this release makes the INSTALL unmistakable and proves the no-repo-needed
claim with tests, rather than changing that discovery behavior itself.

1. **`docs/INSTALL.md`** (new, top-level, linked from the README):
   leads with one install line per platform -- from a clone,
   `uv tool install --reinstall .` (or `pipx install --force -e .`, with
   a PEP 668 note for Kali/Debian 12+), or directly from GitHub with no
   clone at all, `uv tool install git+https://github.com/roloVibes/Halo-
   Harness` -- then "cd anywhere, type `halo`". The clone directory is for
   `git pull` only; the exact same reinstall command runs again after
   every pull. Keeps its own "Upgrading from rolo-claude 1.0.1" section;
   `docs/harness/INSTALL.md` (the exhaustive walkthrough -- PEP 668 detail,
   the offline work-box recipe, terminal notes) is unchanged and linked
   from the new page.
2. **`doctor`/`init`'s PATH check now names which of three things `halo`
   resolves to**, not just OK/WARN: the installed console script (OK, now
   labelled "installed console script" in the line itself), this
   checkout's own `bin/halo`/`bin/halo.cmd` wrapper (WARN, now says
   plainly "not the installed console script"), or neither at all (WARN,
   now names the PYTHONPATH fallback by name instead of just "not found").
   `halo init`'s summary still ends with this same check plus "Run it
   from any directory -- the checkout is only for `git pull`." whenever
   it isn't the installed copy.
3. **No remaining dependency on the repo directory, proven by test**:
   `bin/halo`, `bin/halo.cmd` and `bin/rolo-claude` were already thin
   fallbacks (prefer an installed console script on PATH, only then fall
   back to `PYTHONPATH=<repo>`) and every vendored data file (the model
   table, the OpenRouter/Databricks catalog fallbacks, the TUI's
   `styles.tcss`) already loaded relative to the package, not the cwd --
   a new test now imports the package with the process `cwd` set to a
   directory outside the checkout and loads each of them directly, so a
   future regression back to a cwd- or repo-relative path fails loudly.
   No test in the suite assumes its own cwd is the repo root (audited).
4. **New tests prove the acceptance criteria directly**: `halo --version`,
   `halo doctor` and `halo -p` each run as a subprocess from a scratch
   directory outside the checkout (literally under the OS temp dir --
   `/tmp` on Linux/Kali); a further `halo -p` test builds a scratch
   project whose `CLAUDE.md` holds one unique sentence and, with a mock
   upstream standing in for the model, asserts that exact sentence
   reached the assembled request body.
5. **Launch hang fixed** (owner's own live use on a Databricks-only work
   VM): `halo` printed the migration line, then sat for a long time before
   the TUI appeared. Cause: `providers.enablement.credentials_present
   ("claude_subscription")`/`init_providers.claude_login_available()` each
   called `claude auth status` directly, uncached, from several places
   startup reaches synchronously -- on a box where the installed `claude`
   is wired to a gateway (Databricks, through Claude Code's own settings
   env) that subprocess hung for its full 10s timeout, every single call.
   Fixed:
   - `credentials_present("claude_subscription")`/`claude_login_
     available()` now read ONLY the existing startup worker's cache
     (`cc_models.cached_claude_auth_status()`) -- a cache miss reads as
     "not detected yet" and never spawns anything itself. The flows that
     genuinely need a fresh, live answer right now (`halo init`'s tabs
     and sequential/`--provider claude` paths, `halo doctor`, and the
     `halo providers` / headless `/providers` listings, which are always
     a fresh process and otherwise printed a real claude.ai login as
     "not set up") call the existing `refresh_cached_claude_auth_status()`
     explicitly instead, once, off the UI thread where one exists.
   - New gateway rule (`cc_models.is_claude_gateway_driven`): when
     `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`/`ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` (shell env or Claude
     Code's own trust-filtered settings chain) or a settings `apiKeyHelper`
     are present, `claude` is gateway-driven and `claude auth status` is
     never spawned at all, by any caller, including the startup worker and
     `halo doctor`'s own check -- `/providers`/`halo providers` show "not
     set up (claude is configured for a gateway)" instead of an ambiguous
     "not set up". The same check also short-circuits `model.
     parse_model_ref`'s bare-alias resolution (`cc_models.default_bare_
     alias_route`), the other place this exact subprocess could hang
     synchronously before a session's first turn.
   - `tui/app.py`'s existing startup worker remains the ONLY launch-time
     spawner for the TUI; it now also posts a one-time, quiet notify once
     it lands, when (and only when) a usable subscription is actually
     found. Headless mode has no UI thread to protect and no startup
     worker of its own -- `/providers` run headlessly refreshes inline,
     staleness-gated, right there (`commands/builtins.py::_cmd_providers`),
     instead of a thread on every `build_session` call -- verified live,
     that ran one real `claude auth status` subprocess PER SESSION BUILT
     on a box with a genuine `claude` install, slowing this project's own
     test suite considerably; refreshing only where `/providers` is
     actually used headlessly avoids that entirely.
   - `--debug`/`-d` now also prints a `[timeline]` line per startup phase
     (settings, instructions, session build, MCP discovery, first paint),
     each with milliseconds elapsed, to both stderr and `bridge.log`
     (`halo_harness/debug_timeline.py`).
6. **Single executable**: `pyproject.toml`'s `[project.scripts]` now ships
   exactly `halo` -- `rolo-claude` is no longer a second installed console
   script. The 2.0.0 CHANGELOG entry above promised the `rolo-claude`
   alias would keep working "forever" as an installed console script; that
   is superseded by the owner's own first real install attempt on a work
   VM, where an old, separately-installed `rolo-claude` 1.0.1 tool already
   owned that name and made a fresh `uv tool install --editable .` of Halo
   fail outright (`Executable already exists: rolo-claude (use --force to
   overwrite)`) -- `halo` never got installed at all. `rolo-claude` keeps
   working as a deprecated alias two other ways that never register a
   second console script: `bin/rolo-claude` (run straight from a checkout)
   and `cli.main_deprecated_alias` (kept in the source, just no longer a
   pyproject entry point). Uninstalling the old tool first is still
   recommended, so the stale command can't run by mistake -- but a Halo
   install itself must never fail because the old tool exists, and now it
   can't. `halo doctor` gains a WARN when a `rolo-claude` other than this
   checkout's own `bin/rolo-claude` script is still found on PATH, naming
   the matching uninstall command (`uv tool uninstall rolo-claude`/`pipx
   uninstall rolo-claude`/`pip uninstall rolo-claude`) as its fix.
   `docs/INSTALL.md`, `docs/harness/INSTALL.md` and the README's upgrading
   sections are updated to match: uninstalling the old tool is a
   recommendation, not a precondition.
7. **GLM on Databricks: the "pause" was a silent effort mismatch, not a
   hang** (W2a, provider/loop/telemetry side -- see
   [MODELS.md](docs/MODELS.md#databricks-glm-201-glm-briefmd) and
   [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md#glm-seems-to-pause-201)):
   - **The default is sent, not omitted**: an omitted `reasoning_effort`
     on this route means `max`, so a call with no effort configured sends
     `high` explicitly (`ProviderProfile.default_effort_when_unset`, on
     for the Databricks GLM family only), and an effort inherited from
     Claude Code's settings (`effortLevel`, typically `xhigh`) that the
     route does not accept lands on `high` too; an explicit `--effort` or
     `/effort xhigh` is still clamped to `max` as a deliberate choice.
     Switching into a GLM route mid-session applies the same default.
   - **Effort clamp table**: every `databricks-glm-*` endpoint (tabled or
     not) now accepts exactly `low`/`high`/`max`, default `high` (was
     silently sent as whatever the user picked, including values the
     gateway itself then silently coerced to `max` with no error at all --
     `medium -> high`, `minimal -> low`, `xhigh -> max`, `none -> low`,
     via a new `ProviderProfile.effort_clamp_map` `clamp_effort`/`map_effort`
     consult before the generic xhigh/max narrowing). OpenRouter
     `z-ai/glm-5*` keeps the full seven Z.ai-direct values. `--effort`/
     `/effort` show the value actually sent (`medium (sent as high on this
     route)`); a new `providers/effort.py` (`effort_set`, `sent_effort`,
     `requested_vs_sent`) is the one place `/effort`, `/status`, `/context`
     and the stream-json `system/init` line's new `effort`/`effort_sent`
     fields all read this comparison from.
   - **Steer during the silent pre-first-token wait now restarts the
     call**: config `steer.restart_when_silent` (default true) -- when a
     steer arrives and no content has streamed yet for the in-flight call,
     it's aborted and resent immediately with the steer appended (a new
     `steer_restart` event; `--verbose` prints one line) instead of
     waiting for the first chunk to cut in, the way an ordinary mid-stream
     steer already did.
   - **Finish-reason handling**: a chat-dialect `finish_reason:
     "model_context_window_exceeded"` now feeds the existing overflow ->
     compaction -> retry path (previously read as a plain "end_turn");
     `"sensitive"` becomes a clear, never-retried error naming whatever
     text the provider did stream.
   - **GLM never receives `tool_choice: "required"`** (already true via
     `tool_choice_required_supported`, now pinned by test) and temperature
     is clamped to `[0, 1]` on every GLM-family route.
   - **New per-call telemetry** in the session log: `ttfb_ms`,
     `first_reasoning_ms`, `first_text_ms`, `first_tool_ms`,
     `reasoning_streamed` (does this gateway actually stream reasoning
     incrementally, or does it arrive as one lump?). `halo stats --models
     --wide` adds TTFT p50/p95, a count of calls that waited over 20s for
     their first token, and "reasoning streamed" as a percentage, per
     model.
   - **`phase` events** (`events.py`): `request_sent`, `headers`,
     `first_token` (kind: reasoning/text/tool), `waiting_for_model` -- the
     data-side contract a later TUI liveness pass renders a live phase
     line from; print/stream-json output is unchanged (no new stdout
     noise).
8. **Visible thinking, live counters, rotating tips** (W2b, the TUI side
   of the GLM round; see "Is it frozen?" in
   [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md)):
   - A live phase line per model call, ticked by the drain timer at least
     once a second: `Sending request to <model>…`, `Thinking… (12 s, no
     tokens yet)`, `Thinking… (18 s · 412 reasoning tokens)`, `Writing…`,
     `Waiting for model…` between tool results and the next call, then
     `Thought for 18 s` as the summary; after 30 s without data the line
     says so and names Esc and steering.
   - The thinking preview shows the last three lines of streamed
     reasoning in every wire shape, collapses to the summary on
     completion and stays open under Ctrl+O; reasoning that arrives only
     with the final chunk shows the summary at that moment.
   - Status bar: spinner, phase word, elapsed seconds and a received-token
     counter that climbs as chunks arrive; idle only on turn done (a
     mid-turn tool step no longer blanks it). Running tool cards show
     elapsed seconds; a nested sub-agent card shows the child's phase and
     tool count live.
   - Rotating tips replace the static prompt placeholder: 52 curated tips
     plus one generated per slash command, a new tip at launch, after
     every turn and every 15 s while idle, never while typing; `/tips`
     lists them; `tips: false` in config.json or `HALO_TIPS=0` restores a
     plain placeholder; a test checks every command, flag and key a tip
     names.
   - The `/effort` card marks a clamped choice inline (`medium (sent as
     high on this route)`) and the status chip shows the sent value.
9. **Prompt history recall, copy and paste in the chat box** (W2c):
   - Up recalls the prompt just typed in halo again: Claude Code's
     history stores millisecond timestamps and halo stored seconds, so
     the merged sort put every Claude Code entry after every halo entry.
     Both units are normalised at read time and halo now writes
     milliseconds; Up on an empty first line recalls the newest entry, a
     typed prefix walks only matching entries, Down past the newest
     restores the draft; a steer or slash command typed over a pending
     card also reaches history.
   - Ctrl+C copies a selection made inside the chat box (OSC 52 plus the
     external-tool fallback) instead of arming quit; Ctrl+X cuts it;
     Ctrl+A selects all; Ctrl+V pastes from the system clipboard through
     xclip, xsel or wl-paste, pbpaste, or PowerShell Get-Clipboard when
     one exists, otherwise it names the terminal's own paste shortcut.
     Bracketed paste is unchanged. The keys are listed in the F1 help and
     in TROUBLESHOOTING.md "Copy and paste".
   - Status bar: the phase word follows the phase line within one drain
     tick (a reasoning model's thinking-to-writing transition fired no
     second phase event); when the bar overflows it drops the MCP count,
     then the balance, then shortens the cwd to its last component
     instead of slicing a path mid-word.
10. **Deprecation notice**: the legacy env file `~/.config/vibes-hacker/env`
    (still read as a fallback behind the new `~/.config/halo/env`, see the
    2.0.0 entry above) stops being read starting in 2.0.4 (the hardening
    release) -- move any credential that still lives only in the old file
    into the new one (`halo init`, or hand-edit) before upgrading past 2.0.3.
11. **MCP "explain the zero"**: `/mcp`, `halo mcp list` and `doctor` now
    name every scope they actually searched -- user scope, this
    directory's project-local scope, this directory's own `.mcp.json`,
    plugins, managed -- with the count found in each, and name another
    directory's `.mcp.json` the user's own history remembers (never a
    bare "0 servers" with no indication where it looked). A server that
    fails to connect now says why instead of a bare "Failed to connect":
    command not found on PATH, connection refused on `host:port`, or a
    disabled transport's own reason.
12. **claude.ai connectors reachable from any model**: when `claude` is
    installed and logged into claude.ai, each account-side connector
    becomes a `connector__<slug>` tool any model can call
    (`{request, tool, args}`) -- it runs a headless `claude -p` scoped to
    just that connector's own tools and returns the result through the
    usual MCP caps, so a connector is no longer usable only from inside a
    real `claude` session. Discovery runs in the background from `claude
    mcp list` and the stream-json init line, cached under `~/.halo/mcp/
    connectors.json`; `/mcp` shows each connector's status and the
    re-auth step; config `connectors.bridge` and a per-connector
    `enabled`/`alwaysLoad`; a settings rule written for the Claude Code
    tool name applies to the bridge tool too.
    - **Cold start**: with an empty cache, `claude` on PATH and a claude.ai
      login, `halo mcp list` discovers synchronously (a 20s cap) and shows
      the connectors without `--refresh`; a print-mode run does the same
      before its tool catalog freezes only when a connector is actually
      wanted (`--tools` naming one, a ToolSearch that asks for one, or
      `connectors.discover_on_start: true`), so a plain `-p` call is never
      held up by a login probe it did not need.
    - **Landing live in a running TUI**: when the cache was cold at
      startup, the background kick used to run before any claude.ai auth
      status was even cached, so eligibility refused it and a cold-cache
      TUI never learned its connectors at all for the whole session (no
      note, 0/0 connectors). The startup worker that primes the auth
      cache now re-kicks the same once-per-process discovery the moment
      its own refresh says claude.ai login, and the connector tools join
      the catalog with one transcript note saying how many arrived,
      typically within 8s of a cold start. The auth-cache priming `halo
      mcp list`/`halo providers` do is skipped once the cache is already
      fresh, so repeated CLI calls stop re-running the `claude` probe
      every time.
13. **`halo mcp serve`, importing from Claude Desktop, and a real OAuth
    login**: no `mcp` subcommand is a stub any more. `halo mcp serve` runs
    Halo's own built-in tools as a stdio MCP server (driven by a real MCP
    client in the tests); `add-from-claude-desktop` imports Claude
    Desktop's own server config; `reset-project-choices` clears a
    project's remembered `.mcp.json` approvals. `halo mcp login`/`logout`
    run a generic OAuth 2.0 authorization-code flow with PKCE, endpoint
    discovery and a local callback, naming no vendor, with tokens under
    `~/.halo/mcp/oauth/`; the tokens are now actually used -- http/sse
    servers send `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>`, a 401 refreshes
    the token once, and otherwise says to run `halo mcp login <name>`
    (tested against a local fake authorization server, never a real one).
14. **14 more hook events, and the flag list finished**: Setup,
    UserPromptExpansion, MessageDisplay, TaskCreated/TaskCompleted
    (sub-agents), StopFailure, InstructionsLoaded, ConfigChange,
    CwdChanged, DirectoryAdded, FileChanged, WorktreeCreated,
    PreModelSwitch and PostModelSwitch now fire from their natural
    trigger points with documented payloads; only WorktreeRemoved
    (nothing removed a worktree yet -- fixed two parts later, see below)
    and the two MCP elicitation events (no elicitation protocol in this
    build) stayed accepted-and-ignored, and the README/handbook/
    architecture doc say exactly that. No CLI flag is left "not yet": 21
    are real (`--restricted`, `--brief`, `--environment`, `--autocompact`,
    `--include-hook-events`, `--permission-prompt-tool`,
    `--permission-prompts`, `--plugin-dir`/`--plugin-url`, `--betas`,
    `--tmux`, `--worktree`, `--ax-screen-reader`, `--bg`,
    `--no-session-persistence`, `--prompt-suggestions`,
    `--fallback-model`, `--forward-subagent-text`,
    `--exclude-dynamic-system-prompt-sections`, `--system-prompt-
    snapshot`) and 7 cloud/IDE flags are declared not applicable with a
    one-line reason each (`--cloud`, `--teleport`, `--remote-control` and
    its prefix, `--from-pr`, `--ide`, `--safe-mode`, accepted with no
    effect); `docs/COMMANDS.md` documents each one.
15. **Skills inside sub-agents, their asks reach the dock, `/rewind`
    covers files a step touched**: a skill with `context: fork` or
    `agent` runs in a general-purpose sub-agent instead of reporting "not
    implemented"; AskUserQuestion and permission asks from a child --
    including a background one -- reach the parent's own pending dock
    tagged with the agent's name and are answered there. `/rewind`/
    `/undo`/`/redo` now cover more than the logged conversation: a step's
    own new files are deleted on undo and recreated on redo, NotebookEdit
    changes are shadow-copied, and a Bash command's new files in a git
    repo are captured through a status diff; a Bash shadow also captures
    TRACKED files a command modified, not just new ones, so rewinding
    past an edit a command itself made restores them too (a file already
    dirty before the command ran is a documented limit either way).
16. **Clipboard quality, and Ctrl+C says what it does**: copying from the
    transcript or a tool card now copies the widget's own SOURCE text,
    never the screen cells -- trailing spaces gone, soft wraps intact,
    the transcript's own glyphs/borders removed, a multi-widget selection
    joined in document order, a code block kept exactly as written, `\n`
    line endings everywhere (`clipboard.crlf` for CRLF). New copy actions
    need no mouse: `/copy` (last reply), `/copy code`/`/copy code N`
    (fenced blocks), `/copy tool` (last tool output), `y` on a focused
    tool card or in the pager (its full content), `Y` (the whole current
    turn); every copy ends with a toast naming what was copied and how
    many characters. OSC 52 is trusted only where the terminal actually
    relays it (Windows Terminal yes, a plain conhost window no); a real
    `clip.exe` fallback (UTF-16 input) exists on Windows and `pbcopy` on
    macOS, and `doctor` names the mechanism actually in use. Ctrl+C's
    toast reads "Press Ctrl+C again to exit halo (your terminal stays
    open)"; config `quit_on_double_ctrl_c: false` turns the double-press
    exit off entirely, so only `/exit`, Ctrl+D or Ctrl+Q leave, and the F1
    help, TROUBLESHOOTING.md and the input placeholder's own rotating tip
    all say so.
17. **Fallback models, background-job hooks, plugin skills/hooks/MCP,
    worktree removal, and more flags wired for real**: `--fallback-model`
    is wired into the retry ladder -- when a retryable provider failure
    exhausts its retries, the session swaps to the next fallback model
    for the rest of the turn with one notice naming both. Background
    Bash jobs now fire TaskCreated/TaskCompleted with the job id,
    command, status and exit code, the way sub-agents already did.
    `--plugin-dir`/`--plugin-url` load a plugin's skills, hooks and MCP
    servers as well as its agents, following Claude Code's own plugin
    layout; plugin skills are namespaced `<plugin>:<skill>` and reachable
    by the Skill tool, not only from the slash menu. `halo worktree rm
    <path>` and config `worktree.remove_on_exit` fire WorktreeRemoved --
    removal itself had never worked at all before this: it ran `git` from
    a directory that was not a working tree, and on Windows from inside
    the very directory being deleted. `--betas` sends the
    `anthropic-beta` header only on Anthropic-family routes (it had been
    leaking to OpenRouter and Databricks chat requests); `--prompt-
    suggestions` also works in the stream-json multi-turn loop; `halo bg
    list|logs|stop|rm` manage a detached `--bg` run.
18. **Process-group kills can no longer hit the harness itself**: `halo bg
    stop`, the Bash tool's timeout kill and the `cc:` child's interrupt/
    kill now signal a child's own process group only when that group is
    not the harness's own, and a PID sharing our group is killed alone;
    killed children are reaped, so a zombie no longer counts as "still
    alive". Found because a new `halo bg stop` test spawned a plain child
    inside the suite runner's own process group and, on Linux, killed the
    runner, its wrapper shell and the whole SSH session every time the
    suite reached that test. The suite runner is now line-buffered too,
    so a run killed mid-way still leaves its true last line on disk
    instead of a stale module header stuck in a block buffer.
19. **A runbook for the checks that need a real terminal or login,
    steadier suites, and a privacy scan test**: `docs/harness/
    LIVE-CHECKS.md` lists exactly what to run and look for the checks a
    mock upstream can't stand in for (a real terminal, a real `claude`
    login, a real MCP server), gated behind `HALO_LIVE=1` in
    `tests/live/`. The `cc:` session, CLI-flag and chrome/playwright smoke
    tests now poll with a bounded deadline instead of a fixed sleep, so a
    loaded machine makes them slower, never red; the flaky first-run
    `cc:` session case on Linux is covered by three standalone repeats in
    the Kali run. Fixture homes, example paths and sample MCP server
    names across tests and docs are synthetic now, never a real machine/
    project/hobby-gear name; `tests/test_privacy_scan.py` fails the suite
    outright if one of those comes back, or a real LAN address, home path
    or key-shaped string does (`tests/privacy_scan_allowlist.txt` holds
    the deliberate test fakes) -- it walks the tree directly rather than
    erroring out on a copy with no `.git` (the Kali suite runs from a tar
    copy).
20. **Two rounds of release review, before the tag**: a full read of the
    whole 2.0.1 diff against every part's own commit message. Round A
    found 2 critical and 16 major defects -- among them a
    `--no-session-persistence` run with `-c`/`--resume` that deleted the
    very conversation it resumed, the TUI silently ignoring
    `--restricted`/`--fallback-model`/`--plugin-dir`/`--betas`/`--brief`/
    `-w`, a cross-provider `--fallback-model` that sent the fallback's
    request with the PRIMARY provider's key, and `isolation: worktree`
    sub-agents whose edits landed outside their own permission scope --
    each fixed with its own pinning test, alongside the
    `--restricted`/`--betas`/`--brief` parity gaps above. Round B found 20
    more minors and the remaining 7 parity gaps: a background sub-agent's
    own dock card that never finalized once it actually finished; a
    steer-restart that silently inflated the next real retry's backoff; a
    `git worktree remove --force` fallback that discarded a session's own
    uncommitted edits on exit; `@server:uri`/`git@host:path` false
    positives in the unresolved-mention warning (and that warning finally
    reaching the user, not just the model, as documented); Windows
    Ctrl+V/`clip.exe` mangling non-ASCII paste/copy text; a connector call
    missing `--no-session-persistence` and running in the wrong cwd; an
    `--autocompact` flag a settings.json `env` block could silently
    outrank; and several telemetry, doctor and timeline-text fixes.
    Docstrings that quoted the owner by name or a private project
    directory were reworded, and the privacy scan above now also checks,
    case-insensitively, for the owner's hobby-gear tool names and the
    owner's own name.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-09-30

A hotfix release from the owner's first real 1.0.0 run on the Kali work VM
(DNS down, then fixed), a live `/model` screenshot from it, and several
days of live use on a work VM after that. Nineteen fixes, all with pinning
tests:

1. **Completion popup keys**: with the `/`/`@` completion popup open,
   Up/Down move the highlight, Tab/Enter accept it, Esc closes it, typing
   still filters -- the prompt's own TextArea no longer swallows Up/Down
   (history nav) while the popup is open.
2. **Fail fast on DNS/connection failures**: a hung/unresolvable host used
   to take upwards of 60s to fail (the OS resolver's own retry policy,
   completely unbounded); every connect (DNS included, not just the TCP
   handshake) is now capped at 8s, and a DNS/refused/unreachable failure
   never rides the 1-2-4-8-16s retry ladder (one immediate retry, then
   terminal) -- across `-p`, the TUI, `init`'s pong, `models --refresh`,
   `/models refresh`, and `doctor`. The error names the host: "cannot
   resolve/reach `<host>` -- check the machine's network, DNS or VPN".
3. **`/models` shows the cache instantly**: bare `/models` (TUI or
   headless) and `rolo-claude models` (CLI) never touch the network any
   more -- a bug in the TUI's own do-refresh check made even a BARE
   `/models` refresh over the network. Only `/models refresh`/`/dbx`/
   `--refresh` do; a failed refresh still shows the (unchanged) cached
   table plus one line naming the error.
4. **Cache carries the gateway types**: every cached row now shows a real
   `path` (family default, from `dbx_routing`) and `chat-capable` counts
   the endpoint's own `task == "llm/v1/chat"` (never a name-based guess or
   `bool(api_types)`, which used to disagree with the table on the same
   rows). An old cache from before this milestone (no `api_types` at all)
   is detected and migrated on next background refresh, else shown as
   "path unknown (refresh needed)" rather than a silently wrong guess.
5. **Interactive model picker in `init`**: a filterable arrow-key list of
   chat-capable endpoints grouped by family (a numbered list with no real
   terminal) offered right after the catalog is refreshed; `--yes`/
   `--model` skip it. The TUI's own `/model` picker got the same grouping.
6. **Bare endpoint names**: `--model databricks-kimi-k3`/`/model
   databricks-kimi-k3`/`init --model databricks-kimi-k3` resolve exactly
   like `dbx:databricks-kimi-k3` whenever the name matches a cached
   endpoint (even a workspace-custom name with no `databricks-`/
   `system.ai.` shape) or that generic shape; an unresolvable name
   suggests the three closest cached endpoints instead of a bare error.
7. **List-dialog keyboard forwarding**: every filter-`Input` + `OptionList`
   dialog (`/model`, `/resume`, the command palette, `init`'s own picker)
   forwards Up/Down/PageUp/PageDown/Home/End to the list and Enter to the
   highlighted row, instead of the `Input` silently swallowing them (Down
   in `/model` used to do nothing at all).
8. **`/model` rows, single line**: grouped with one header per group
   instead of an inline `[group]` tag, each row ellipsized rather than
   wrapped (a long ref/path used to break the column alignment).
9. **`cc:` group gating**: shown only when `claude auth status` reports an
   actual claude.ai login -- a Databricks work box's own settings-driven
   `claude` login used to list nine `cc:` models that would refuse at
   request time.
10. **Unified `ctx`/`out`/price columns**: `/model`, `/models`,
    `rolo-claude models`, and `init`'s own picker now show the SAME
    context/output/USD-per-1M-token columns for every provider, Databricks
    included (previously `path=... dbu=?` only, with "?" everywhere) --
    normalized units (`200000` -> `200k`, `1048576`/`1050000` -> `1M`),
    blank (never `?`) for anything not published. Databricks pricing comes
    from models.dev when that endpoint is listed there, else
    `model_table.json`'s own context (prices blank), else blank.
    `fetch_models_dev` now sends a real `User-Agent` (models.dev's CDN can
    403 a header-less default urllib agent).
11. **`VERIFY_X509_STRICT` cleared on every TLS context**: Python 3.13
    turned this on by default; a corporate TLS-inspection proxy's
    re-signing CA can carry a technically-non-conformant certificate
    extension that only this stricter mode rejects (curl/browsers/Node/
    pre-3.13 Python all accept it) -- seen live as `models --refresh`
    failing with `CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED: ... basic constraints of CA
    cert not marked critical` on a work VPN while a Databricks pong (a
    different, inspection-exempt host) kept working. Fixed for every
    HTTPS call this harness makes; certificate-chain/hostname verification
    itself is unchanged.
12. **`init` is provider-first**: step 1 is now "select a provider to set
    up" (Databricks/OpenRouter/Anthropic API/Claude subscription) with a
    status tag per row, instead of a home/work/claude "preset" naming a
    bundle of choices ("work" WAS just Databricks, confusingly named).
    Each provider runs its own credentials -> catalog -> model-pick ->
    live-pong path, offers to set up another, and picks one overall
    default when more than one ends up configured. `--provider` (repeatable)
    drives it non-interactively; the old `--preset home|work|claude` still
    works, as a deprecated one-line-noticed alias.
13. **Status bar shows real context/cost for every model, Databricks
    included**: `ctx 12k/1M 1%` (or `ctx 12k` alone with no known limit)
    and a real `$0.0123` (or `in 12k out 3k` token totals with no known
    price) replace the permanent `ctx ?`/`$?` a Databricks model used to
    show. `CostMeter` no longer hard-codes Databricks cost as always
    unknown -- it computes a real fallback cost whenever a models.dev price
    was resolved for that endpoint, same formula every other provider
    already used. The model label truncates from the left on a narrow
    terminal so ctx/cost stay visible; cwd shrinks first.
14. **The transcript follows new output**: streamed text, thinking blocks,
    and expanding tool cards used to leave the view wherever the user's own
    prompt was after the first line -- `Transcript` now anchors to the
    bottom (Textual's own `anchor()`) while "following," releases on a
    manual scroll up (showing a "↓ N new" count in the status bar), and
    re-anchors on `Ctrl+End`, a click on that indicator, or a new prompt.
15. **A pending permission/plan/question card intercepts free text**:
    typing while one is pending used to always steer the turn underneath it
    silently -- it now answers the card directly (deny-with-feedback, keep-
    planning, or "Other", matching Claude Code's own behavior), and
    switching to `auto`/`bypassPermissions`/`dontAsk` (`Shift+Tab`) now
    resolves an already-pending permission card immediately instead of
    leaving it stuck. The status bar shows a "permission needed: ..." tag
    and the prompt placeholder changes while one is pending. This, combined
    with fix 14, was the real mechanism behind a reported TUI "freeze."
16. **`init` also asks for a default permission mode**: `auto` (recommended),
    `acceptEdits`, `default`, `plan` -- written to `~/.rolo-claude/
    config.json`'s own `permission_mode` key, now a layer in the starting-
    mode precedence chain between `--permission-mode` and settings.json's
    `permissions.defaultMode`. `doctor` prints the effective mode and its
    source.
17. **Worker-group isolation and a hard Ctrl+Q**: the git-branch and
    statusline timers (`exclusive=True`, no `group=`) were silently
    cancelling every other in-flight background worker (models refresh,
    catalog refresh, session list, `/improve` drafts, ...) every 5 seconds
    -- each now runs in its own named group, as does every `tui/slash.py`
    worker. `Ctrl+Q` force-quits within 2 seconds even if the session is
    wedged; a Key event with no focused widget now self-heals focus back to
    the prompt (or the active modal's own first focusable widget).
18. **Databricks Claude foundation endpoints reject `xhigh`**: a Databricks
    Claude route's `output_config.effort` only accepts `low`/`medium`/
    `high`/`max` -- a session with no more specific effort set now defaults
    every Anthropic-family route (`cc:`/`ant:`/Databricks Claude foundation)
    to `high` instead of leaving it unset, and `xhigh` is clamped to `max`
    on any route that doesn't list it (a `/model` switch re-clamps too). A
    live 400 naming the effort field retries once with it stripped before
    the turn is treated as failed.
19. **`/effort` actually changes the level**: it used to ignore its own
    argument and only ever echo a value snapshotted at session start
    (typing `/effort medium` kept showing whatever was configured before
    launch). `/effort <level>` now sets the session's effort immediately
    (clamped per fix 18), remembered for the rest of the session; bare
    `/effort` in the TUI opens an inline Claude-Code-style selector card
    (the route's own accepted levels in a row, Left/Right to move, Enter to
    apply, Esc to keep the old value) instead of only printing text. The
    status bar shows a short effort tag next to the mode.
20. **gpt-6 rejects `reasoning_effort` alongside tools**: every turn on
    `dbx:databricks-gpt-6-sol` 400'd ("Function tools with reasoning_effort
    are not supported for gpt-6-sol... set reasoning_effort to 'none'") --
    any endpoint whose name contains `gpt-6` now sends `reasoning_effort:
    "none"` explicitly whenever the request carries tools (a tool-less
    request, or `--effort`/`/effort` on any other family, is unaffected); a
    live 400 with this wording on a different OpenAI-family endpoint
    retries once with the same explicit override.
21. **Enter runs a completed `/` command** (Claude Code parity): with the
    completion popup open, one Enter both inserts the highlighted `/`
    command and runs it (`/mo` + Enter opens the model picker; `/models` +
    Enter runs it). A second Enter used to be required, which read as
    "/models does nothing". Tab still only inserts, and an `@` path
    completion is only ever inserted.
22. **`vendor/model` needs both halves**: `/effort`, `vendor/` and refs
    containing whitespace are refused locally with the usual no-route
    error instead of being accepted as an OpenRouter model and failing
    upstream with a 400 on the first request.

No behavior changes beyond the fixes above; `__version__` is the only
non-test/non-doc change outside the files each fix's own commit touched.

### Review fix pass (same day)

A follow-up review of the fixes above, before this hotfix shipped, found
18 further issues. The following were fixed, each with its own pinning
test; two low-risk minors (a second pending-card slot for concurrent
sub-agent asks, and the connect-timeout retry/leak detail) are deferred --
see "1.0.1 follow-ups" in `docs/harness/RECOMMENDATIONS.md`.

- **`/model` no longer freezes the TUI**: it opened on the UI thread,
  re-read and re-parsed the full `models-dev.json` cache once PER
  Databricks endpoint, and spawned `claude auth status` synchronously --
  2-5s measured on a real catalog. The picker now opens through a worker
  thread; the models.dev cache loads once per `/model` open, not once per
  row; the `claude auth status` check is a cached read, primed once by a
  startup worker, never spawned by `/model` itself.
- **Post-connect network failures ride the retry ladder again**: a
  dropped keep-alive or mid-response reset (after the TCP connection was
  already open) carried the same "cannot resolve/reach" marker a genuine
  DNS/connect failure uses, so it skipped the retry ladder entirely
  instead of riding it like the pre-hotfix 502 behavior. Only a real
  connect-phase failure carries that marker now.
- **Focus self-heal stays on the active screen**: a modal with nothing
  focusable of its own (the pager `o` opens) no longer heals focus to a
  pending card on the screen underneath it, which used to let the modal's
  own keys (`q`/`o`) vanish in favor of the hidden card's (`1`/`y` could
  silently approve a permission the user never saw).
- **`Shift+Tab` re-evaluates a pending permission card for real**:
  switching mode now re-runs the permission engine for the parked
  request instead of blindly allowing/denying it -- an explicit `ask:`
  rule still asks under `auto` (only `bypassPermissions` skips it),
  `acceptEdits` now resolves a pending in-workdir edit/write card, and a
  card the user is already answering (pressed `4`, typing why) is left
  alone instead of being silently finished out from under them.
- **`Ctrl+Q` has its own flag**: it no longer shares `_quitting` with
  double-`Ctrl+C`/`/quit`, so it still works when THAT path is the one
  that's hung; a daemon timer force-kills the process 2.5s after
  `self.exit()` regardless of what Textual/asyncio is still waiting on.
- **Databricks cost is billed once per token, and repriced on `/model`**:
  cached/reasoning tokens were counted at both the full rate and their own
  discounted rate; switching to a new Databricks endpoint mid-session now
  updates the cost meter's own rates instead of billing new usage at the
  old model's prices.
- **OpenRouter prices show again**: `models.json` stores them as numeric
  strings; every price reader now accepts that (`/model`, `rolo-claude
  models`, and `init`'s picker all went blank otherwise).
- **WebFetch and MCP http/sse use the shared TLS policy**: both were
  outside fix 11 above (a different code path -- urllib's own
  `build_opener`/httpx's own client, neither going through
  `open_upstream`).
- **`init` never overwrites an existing `permission_mode`/`model`**:
  `--yes` and Esc now keep whatever's already configured (writing nothing
  at all on a fresh box) instead of forcing `auto`/a fixed-order guess
  over what was actually there.
- **An effort-rejection 400 no longer wastes its one retry on the wrong
  fix**: the gpt-6 "none with tools" classifier (fix 20 above) matched too
  broadly -- any 400 naming both "reasoning_effort" and the bare word
  "param". The general strip-the-field retry can now run after a failed
  "none" retry instead of being blocked by a shared one-shot flag, and a
  successful strip resets the session's effort so later steps don't keep
  re-sending the rejected value first.
- **The Anthropic "high" default (fix 18 above) is scoped to
  adaptive-capable models**: a non-adaptive route (Haiku 4.5, Sonnet 4.5
  or older) no longer gets a thinking budget nearly as large as
  `max_tokens` by default (capped at half of it instead); the version
  parser reads hyphenated ids (`claude-sonnet-4-6`) correctly; the
  `tool_choice: any` repair retry drops thinking (Anthropic rejects that
  combination outright).
- **The gpt-6 "none with tools" rule (fix 20 above) is Databricks-only**,
  driven by explicit `model_table.json` rows for both real `models.dev`
  name shapes -- it no longer also fires for an OpenRouter model that
  happens to have "gpt-6" in its name.
- **Chat-dialect routes no longer accept `max`** (an Anthropic-only
  level) from `/effort`; the retry also recognizes OpenRouter's nested
  `reasoning.effort` 400 wording and a generic "Invalid value" one.
- **Commands typed while a card is pending run instead of denying the
  tool**: a `/`-prefixed submission always goes to slash handling first,
  whatever card is pending; pasted feedback carries the real content, not
  the `[Pasted text #n]` placeholder; the `/effort` card no longer
  intercepts typed text at all.
- **A tall card's auto-scroll is restored once answered**: focusing a
  card too large to fit releases the transcript's bottom anchor (fix 14
  above; Textual's own scroll-to-center on focus); `clear_pending_card`
  now re-anchors when the user was following before the card appeared.
- Wording: `init`'s "default" permission mode no longer implies a risk
  check this project doesn't have ("ask before edits and non-read-only
  tools", not "...or otherwise risky").
- **Rate-limit and stats token counts include reasoning again**: since
  `map_usage` reports reasoning tokens separately (so they are never
  billed twice), the Databricks output-tokens-per-minute tracker and
  `stats` `tokens_out` now add them back, or a reasoning-heavy reply
  under-counted and the 429s the tracker prevents came back.
- **MCP over HTTP prefers the pinned `httpx2`** and falls back to classic
  `httpx` only when `httpx2` is absent, so an environment carrying both
  never hands the MCP SDK the wrong client type.
- **Adaptive thinking is gated to Opus 4.6+**: Opus 4.1 and 4.5 (both
  served on Databricks) keep `budget_tokens`, as Sonnet below 4.6 already
  did; every `opus` id used to count as adaptive. Bedrock-style ids that
  put the version before the family (`us-anthropic-claude-3-7-sonnet-...`)
  now parse their real version instead of the snapshot date.

`__version__` is unchanged.

### Part 2 (same release): tabbed provider setup, hang diagnostics, provider enablement, effort polish

Finishes the 1.0.1 round -- item 13's tabbed provider view, item 15's
remaining hang diagnostics, the new item 21 provider-enablement model, and
item 22's remainder -- plus five minors the reviewer logged after the fix
pass above. All with pinning tests; `__version__` stays 1.0.1.

- **`init`'s provider setup is now tabbed** (item 13): one tab per provider
  -- Databricks, OpenRouter, Anthropic API (key), Claude Code subscription,
  and a new fifth tab, TypeSafe (stores `TYPESAFE_API_KEY` only, for a
  later feature -- no routed models yet) -- replacing the one-provider-at-
  a-time picker loop on a REAL terminal only (a piped/non-tty run, every
  existing script, keeps the exact old sequential-picker-plus-numbered-
  fallback path, byte for byte). Shift+Tab and Left/Right (the latter only
  while the tab bar itself has focus -- a focused credential field's own
  Left/Right still moves the cursor) switch tabs; Up/Down move between a
  tab's own fields/button; Enter activates a field or button; Esc leaves
  the dialog and `init` proceeds to the default-model/permission-mode
  steps exactly as before. Each tab opens showing what the harness already
  picked up ("picked up from `<source>`: `<masked>`", or a discovered
  Databricks host with just the token field left) with the status line
  updating live as a value is typed; a bounded background probe (the same
  8s connect-only cap item 2 introduced) shows "reachable" / "unreachable:
  `<reason>`" / "not set up"; finishing a tab with real credentials fetches
  and caches that provider's catalog right then, off the UI thread. A
  Textual runtime failure (no real terminal after all) falls back to the
  old sequential picker instead of crashing `init` outright.
- **Provider enablement** (item 21, new): a provider's models now reach
  `/model`/`rolo-claude models`/the `init` default pick/`doctor` only once
  it's EXPLICITLY enabled -- by completing its tab above, by `rolo-claude
  providers enable <name>`/`/providers enable <name>`, or (one-time only,
  for a box with credentials from before this existed) an automatic
  migration `doctor`/`init` run the first time. Detected credentials or a
  `claude.ai` login never enable a provider on their own -- a `cc:` group
  no longer appears in `/model` just because `claude auth status` reports
  a real login (item 9's own gate), and a hand-typed ref for a disabled
  provider is refused with a one-line message naming the fix; a detected-
  but-disabled provider shows one dim hint line in `/model` instead of a
  selectable row. `rolo-claude providers`/`/providers`: a table (enabled,
  credentials found and where, reachable, cached model count) plus
  `enable`/`disable`/`setup <name>`. Labels used everywhere (the tabs,
  `/model`'s group headers, `doctor`, `/providers`): `dbx:` Databricks,
  `or:` OpenRouter, `ant:` Anthropic API (key), `cc:` Claude Code
  subscription -- the full prefix table is in `docs/MODELS.md`.
- **Hang diagnostics** (item 15 remainder): a daemon watchdog thread
  (started from `on_mount`, completely independent of the UI's own event
  loop -- the point is that it keeps working when THAT is what's stuck)
  polls a heartbeat `_tick_spinner` bumps every second; once it's stalled
  past 15s it dumps every thread's stack (`sys._current_frames()`), the
  named background-worker list, and the active screen to
  `~/.rolo-claude/hang-<UTC>.log` (one line also to `bridge.log`), at most
  once a minute while it persists. `SIGUSR1` (POSIX) dumps the same
  diagnostics on demand. `--debug` now also traces, to `bridge.log`: every
  Key event (with the focused widget and active screen), window
  focus/blur, and the start/finish/cancel of every named background
  worker. An audit of `_drain` and every `call_from_thread` call site found
  no unbounded blocking of the UI thread (every `subprocess.run` already
  had a timeout and already ran on its own worker thread; no `Worker.
  wait()`/shared-lock call exists on this path) -- the watchdog above is
  the backstop for whatever that audit missed. (The 1Hz heartbeat timer
  itself is now wired through a lambda instead of the bound `_tick_spinner`
  method directly -- `set_interval` keeps calling whatever reference it was
  first given, so a test that needs to simulate a stalled heartbeat by
  replacing the instance's own `_tick_spinner` was silently still ticking
  the original every second; no production behaviour changes, only what a
  test can now actually stop.)
- **`/effort` and the status bar show `none (tools)`** on a route where the
  gpt-6 table rule or a LEARNED per-endpoint rule applies (item 22
  remainder): the EFFECTIVE value actually sent on a tool-carrying turn,
  not the configured one that route would ignore anyway, with the
  selector card's own description line (and `/effort`'s own source line)
  explaining why. The learned per-endpoint `reasoning_effort_with_tools`
  rule (a live 400 proving an untabled Databricks endpoint also needs it)
  now persists to `~/.rolo-claude/learned-rules.json`, not only in memory
  for the rest of one session -- a NEW session against the same endpoint
  sends it correctly from its very first request, never re-paying for the
  failing one. A `model_table.json` row always wins over a learned entry.
- **Five minors from the reviewer's post-fix-pass notes**, each with its
  own pinning test: `Ctrl+Q` now calls `session.job_registry.kill_all()`
  immediately, before its `os._exit` timer is even armed, instead of only
  deep inside the ordinary (possibly also-wedged) `controller.quit()`
  path it exists to route around; `clamp_effort` clamps an unsupported
  `max` to `xhigh` on a chat-dialect route that has `xhigh` but no `max`
  (the mirror of the existing `xhigh`-without-`max` case), instead of
  falling all the way to the bland `medium` default; `/effort`, `/rewind`
  and `/improve` show a one-line note instead of opening their own card
  while any card (a live permission ask, most importantly) is already
  pending; `init`'s per-provider default-model step no longer overwrites a
  custom model already configured when it merely differs from that
  provider's own hardcoded default (only the final cross-provider pick
  previously preserved a custom value) -- an explicit `--model` this run
  still wins outright; `cached_auth_status_is_stale`'s own TTL is now
  actually consulted (bare `/model`'s own stale-Databricks-catalog-refresh
  worker does the same for the claude-auth-status cache), so a `claude.ai`
  login/logout during a long session is reflected the next time `/model`
  opens, not only after restarting the whole app.
- **State-dir scoping** (found during this round's own fix pass): a test
  module that builds a real `Session`/`Controller` without scoping
  `BRIDGE_STATE_DIR` itself used to only avoid leaking into the REAL
  `~/.rolo-claude/sessions` because an EARLIER module happened to leave
  `BRIDGE_TEST_HOME`/`BRIDGE_STATE_DIR` set -- `tests/run_all.py` now
  snapshots and restores every `BRIDGE_*`/`OPENROUTER_*`/`DATABRICKS_*`/
  `ANTHROPIC_*`/`TYPESAFE_*` env var AROUND EACH MODULE, so this can never
  happen regardless of any one module's own hygiene or import order; its
  own REAL SESSIONS GUARD also now catches a new DIRECTORY under the real
  sessions dir, not only a new `.jsonl` file (1972 empty slug directories,
  invisible to the old file-only glob, were found on the Windows build
  host). The same unscoped-real-machine-state bug also reached
  `~/.rolo-claude/mcp/tools-cache/` (lazy MCP tool caching, item 13's own
  H13 Part A, also resolves via `bridge_home()`) through one compat-matrix
  test that scoped its subprocess check but not its in-process one -- fixed
  the same way, by scoping before the in-process `build_manager` call. The
  `!cmd` inline-shell permission card is now registered with the session's
  own permission-waiter table too, so Shift+Tab/`/permissions` re-evaluates
  it through the exact same `reevaluate_pending_permission` path a live
  tool-call ask already uses, instead of leaving it unaffected by a mode
  change until answered by hand.
- **Addendum**: a bare `rolo-claude` typed outside the checkout did not
  work for the owner on the work VM, because the installed console script
  had never been put on PATH (only the checkout's own `bin/` wrapper had
  ever been used, from inside the checkout). `doctor` gained a "command on
  PATH" check -- OK names the resolved path; a WARN (not found, or
  resolving to the checkout's own `bin/` wrapper) names the exact reinstall
  command for whichever tool is present (`uv tool install --reinstall .`
  run from the checkout, else `pip install --user -e .`) and reminds that
  it's needed again after every `git pull`; `init`'s own Summary ends with
  the same check and, when it fails, the same fix line plus "run it from
  any directory -- the checkout is only for `git pull`." README's quick
  start and `docs/COMMANDS.md`'s `doctor`/`init` sections now say so too.

### Part 2 addenda (same release, same day): Opus 5.5, provider auto-detection, catalogs without init, OpenRouter balance

Four follow-up asks from the owner's live use on his personal Mac and his
work VM, landed the same day as Part 2 above. All with pinning tests;
`__version__` stays 1.0.1.

- **`cc:`/`ant:` explicit `opus-5.5`/`sonnet-5.5` aliases**: `opus`/`sonnet`
  are deliberately-moving "latest" pointers (today both resolve to the
  `-5-5` point release) -- nothing was labelled "5.5" anywhere, so a reader
  had to already know `opus` IS `claude-opus-5-5` to find it. The two new
  names resolve to the identical id the bare pointer already does; `/model`,
  `rolo-claude models` and the init picker now show the resolved id next to
  EVERY `cc:`/`ant:` alias (`cc:opus -> claude-opus-5-5 (latest Opus)`,
  `cc:opus-5.5 -> claude-opus-5-5`), reading as an enumeration the same way
  the Databricks group's own `[<family> · <path>]` tag already does. Full
  alias table in `docs/MODELS.md`.
- **Provider enablement rule REPLACED** (rolo, personal Mac: "never ran
  init... loves that the harness already finds the available keys and
  subscription and uses those"): detected credentials/a real claude.ai
  login now AUTO-enable a provider -- OpenRouter/Anthropic API (key)/
  TypeSafe once their key is found (env file, shell env, or the settings
  env chain), Databricks once a host AND token are found (same sources,
  plus `~/.databrickscfg`), Claude Code subscription (`cc:`) ONLY when
  `claude auth status` reports `loggedIn` with `authMethod` exactly
  `claude.ai` (never for an API-token/custom-base-url-driven `claude`, as
  on a work VM, loggedIn or not). `providers` in config.json now stores
  OVERRIDES only: an explicit `enabled: true`/`false` always wins over
  auto-detection; migration is now a permanent no-op (auto-detection
  already computes live what it used to write once). `/providers`/
  `rolo-claude providers` shows each provider as `auto (detected from
  <source>)` / `disabled by you` / `enabled by you` / `not set up`. A
  hand-typed `cc:` ref refused by pure auto-detection (never an explicit
  override) now names the SAME precise reason (not logged in / claude not
  installed / wrong authMethod, each with its own fix) a turn would have
  failed with anyway, reusing `agent.cc_runtime`'s own preflight check
  instead of a generic "not enabled" line; `doctor`'s default-model check
  got the matching fix for a syntactically-fine-but-unconfigured ref.
- **Catalogs exist without `init`, `/model` lists every enabled provider
  regardless of the current model** (rolo, Mac: "`/model` showed one
  OpenRouter row" because models.json had never been fetched, and it
  vanished entirely after switching to a `cc:` model): a background worker
  now fetches every ENABLED provider's catalog (OpenRouter `/models`,
  Anthropic `/v1/models` -> a new `ant-models.json` cache, Databricks
  endpoint discovery) once at app launch and whenever `/model` opens, if
  missing or older than `databricks.catalog_max_age_hours` (default 24h) --
  never on the UI thread, one dim note when something actually changed.
  `/models refresh`/`rolo-claude models --refresh` now refresh every
  enabled provider, not Databricks/OpenRouter only. `Controller.
  list_models()` already built each provider's group from its own cache
  independent of the session's current model -- the real fix was making
  sure that cache actually gets populated; verified a cached OpenRouter
  group survives switching the session to `cc:opus` unchanged.
- **OpenRouter account balance in the status bar** (rolo: "put the
  remaining balance of an api key... next to... the row of numbers under
  the chat"; corrected mid-round against OpenRouter's real OpenAPI spec --
  the key-info endpoint is `GET /key`, not `/auth/key`, and `/credits`
  needs a separate Management key): a new segment right after cost, `OR
  $12.40 left` or `OR $3.21 used`, populated by a background worker (never
  the UI thread) at launch, every 5 minutes, and once after every turn
  (debounced to at most once a minute). Three-way preference: THIS key's
  own `limit_remaining` (`GET /key`, the ordinary `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`)
  when it has a real limit; else the whole account's remaining credits
  (`GET /credits`, requiring a SEPARATE `OPENROUTER_MANAGEMENT_KEY` --
  never the ordinary key) when that key is configured; else this key's own
  `usage` (a spend figure, labelled "used" not "left" -- the honest
  fallback for an unlimited key with no management key). Both calls are
  best-effort and never raise; a failed refresh leaves whatever was cached
  before untouched (never blanks the segment); the figure dims (never
  disappears) once it's more than 10 minutes old; omitted entirely when
  OpenRouter isn't enabled or nothing has ever been fetched. `/cost` and
  `/providers` print the same cached figure, naming which of the three
  kinds it is, plus the key's own label and the time of the reading.
  `OPENROUTER_MANAGEMENT_KEY` documented in `docs/CONFIG.md`.
- **State-dir/env-scoping audit, round 2**: the SAME `BRIDGE_TEST_HOME`-
  leak class D2.1 found earlier in this release turned up again, three
  more times, now as a `providers`-block/credential-env leak instead of a
  session-log one -- each a test that pops a credential env var in its own
  setup but never restores it (only clears), silently wiping every LATER
  test's own default credential for the rest of that file's run once
  nothing upstream masked it anymore. Fixed in `test_h9b_findings.py`
  (`OPENROUTER_API_KEY`), `test_dbx_work_routing.py`'s own `_EnvSandbox`,
  and `test_work_box.py`'s `test_doctor_work_no_databricks_configured` --
  each now saves and restores the full set it touches, not just pops it.
  A new `tests/helpers/provider_env_defaults.py` gives the ~40 other test
  files that build `or:`/`dbx:`/`ant:` refs to test something else
  entirely (tool dispatch, hooks, compaction, permissions, steering, ...)
  a believable (never real) default credential, since `parse_model_ref`
  now refuses an auto-detected-disabled provider the same way it already
  refused an explicitly-disabled one.

`__version__` is unchanged.

### Final pass (same release, same day): secret-env hygiene and trust-aware Databricks resolution

Two more findings from the 1.0.1 part 2 fixpass review, each with its own pinning test; `__version__` stays 1.0.1.

- **`OPENROUTER_MANAGEMENT_KEY`/`TYPESAFE_API_KEY` now strip from every tool
  child's env**: the fixed secret-key list `tool_child_env`/`cc_child_env`
  use (so Bash/PowerShell/MCP/hooks and the `claude` subprocess never see a
  provider credential) was missing both -- the OpenRouter balance
  management key and the TypeSafe key could otherwise have leaked into a
  tool child's own environment.
- **`resolve_databricks()`'s settings-chain re-derivation is now trust-aware**:
  an untrusted project's own `.claude/settings.json`/`settings.local.json`
  `env` block is dropped before it ever reaches Databricks host/token
  resolution (the same trust gate a real session's `Settings.effective_env`
  already enforces), so a project can never pair its own host with the
  user's token; a token exported in the shell still pairs with a host kept
  in the user's own settings.json env block. Credential listings
  (`/providers`, the init tabs, doctor) apply the same trust rule, the
  user's statusLine script runs with the same stripped child env as hooks
  and tools, and the background catalog and balance workers detect a
  provider through the session's effective env, so a key that lives only
  in a settings.json env block still gets its catalog and balance. The
  launch-time catalog refresh,
  `/model`'s own open-time refresh, the OpenRouter balance worker, and the
  headless session-start Databricks thread now resolve credentials from the
  session's own trust-filtered `effective_env` instead of letting each one
  call bare `resolve_databricks()`/read `os.environ` on its own.

`__version__` is unchanged.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-09-30

rolo-claude 1.0.0: the stable general harness release. Summarises the
Databricks-first correctness/tooling work from the `V2-brief.md` line
(`docs/harness/V2-brief.md`) -- per-family request/stream/error correctness
across every gateway type a workspace can serve (the `0.7.0` line below),
and matrix-driven fixes plus roles (the `0.8.0` line below) -- and a
documentation pass on top of them. rolo-claude itself is unchanged in
scope: still the one general harness driving all four routes (OpenRouter,
Databricks, the Anthropic API, and a Claude subscription via `cc:`), not
renamed, with no new console-script alias.

- **0.7.0 (V2a) recap**: per-family correctness for every Databricks gateway
  dialect the harness routes to (native `anthropic/v1/messages`, `mlflow/
  v1/chat/completions`, `cursor/v1/chat/completions`, and the universal
  `/serving-endpoints/<name>/invocations` fallback) -- thinking/reasoning
  replay per family, usage/cost accounting per type, every error shape
  (400/401/403/404/413/429/5xx) classified correctly, and the two
  work-matrix open questions (reasoning replay after a tool call, route
  split from a stale cache) turned into runnable probes.
- **0.8.0 (V2b+V2c) recap**: `rolo-claude work-matrix show`/`apply` turns a
  `doctor --work --probe-all` report into a suggested fix per failing
  endpoint (and writes the one class of fix that maps onto a real
  `databricks.gateway.<endpoint>` config key); roles
  (`orchestrator`/`coder`/`reviewer`/`researcher`/`small`) let a team point
  different kinds of work at different models via `~/.rolo-claude/
  config.json`/`team.json`'s own `roles` table, `--role NAME=MODEL`,
  `Agent(role=...)`, `/roles`, and `stats --roles`.
- **Docs**: README now documents roles and the work-matrix show/apply
  workflow (real 0.8.0 features that had shipped without a README mention
  until now) and points to a separate sibling project,
  [databricks-claude](https://github.com/roloVibes/databricks-claude), for
  teams that want a Databricks-only edition; `docs/DATABRICKS.md` gained an
  end-to-end team-workflow section tying `team.json` -> `init` -> the work
  matrix -> roles together in one walkthrough; `docs/ROLES.md` cross-links
  it; `docs/harness/README.md`'s milestone index gained a `V2-brief.md` row.
- **Naming, for the record**: `docs/harness/V2-brief.md` (kept as originally
  written -- this project's own build-history convention, see
  `docs/harness/README.md`'s opening note) describes a planned V2d/V2e phase
  renaming this project to `databricks-claude`. That did not happen here --
  the owner instead spun off a **separate** `databricks-claude` repository
  as its own Databricks-only edition for teams, and rolo-claude stayed the
  general four-route harness, released as `1.0.0` rather than `2.0.0`.
- `__version__` -> 1.0.0.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-09-29

V2b+V2c: matrix-driven fixes tooling and roles. See `docs/harness/V2-brief.md`.

- **`rolo-claude work-matrix show/apply`** (`rolo_claude/work_matrix.py`):
  `show <report.json>` renders a `doctor --work --probe-all` JSON report as a
  table with a suggested action per failing endpoint -- 403 -> run this on
  the VPN; a non-200 row with a `--both`-probed "(anthropic gateway)"
  companion row that itself answered 200 -> set `databricks.gateway.
  <endpoint>: anthropic`; any other non-200 -> unknown, report it; a 200 with
  `tool_call_ok: false` -> change the family's tool-call rule in
  `model_table.json`; a 200 with `reasoning_replay_ok: false` -> disable
  thinking for tool loops on that endpoint. `apply <report.json> [--yes]`
  writes only the ONE class that maps onto a real config.json knob (the
  gateway override), after listing every write and asking for confirmation;
  the other three classes are report-only (no per-endpoint config key exists
  for them). Two synthetic sample reports under `tests/fixtures/work-matrix/`
  (`all-green.json`, `all-failures.json`, one row per failure class).
- **Fix: `providers/http.py::call_anthropic_native`'s 404 fallback no longer
  hardcodes the literal, non-existent endpoint name "anthropic"** (flagged
  during V2a) -- `/serving-endpoints/anthropic/v1/messages` is not a real
  workspace endpoint; the fallback now builds `/serving-endpoints/<the real
  endpoint name, from body["model"]>/invocations`, the SAME by-name
  universal fallback every other family/dialect already uses, with no query
  suffix (a plain invocations call never uses Databricks' `?beta=true`
  AI-gateway flag). `tests/helpers/mock_databricks.py`'s own anthropic-
  gateway dispatch is now body-shape-based (a top-level `system` field,
  never present on an openai-chat body) instead of matching that same wrong
  literal path.
- **Roles** (`rolo_claude/roles.py`, H15): `orchestrator`/`coder`/`reviewer`/
  `researcher`/`small` in `team.json` and `~/.rolo-claude/config.json`'s own
  `roles` key (team.json seeded into config.json once, at `init --preset
  work` time, by the same idempotent idiom `gateway_preference` already
  uses). Three new built-in agents -- `Coder` (full read/write tool set),
  `Reviewer` (read-only code review), `Researcher` (Explore's tools +
  WebSearch) -- alongside `general-purpose`/`Explore`/`Plan`, each with a
  fixed default role; a custom `.claude/agents/*.md` agent sets the same
  thing with a `role:` frontmatter key. Resolution precedence: an explicit
  `model=` always wins; then a `--role NAME=MODEL` CLI override for that
  agent's own role (repeatable; wins even over the agent's own file
  `model:` -- a deliberate, freshly-typed, run-only override); then the
  agent file's own `model:`; then the role table; then `CLAUDE_CODE_
  SUBAGENT_MODEL`/`settings.subagentModel`; then the parent/session model
  (`orchestrator`'s own documented default). The `Agent`/`Task` tool itself
  accepts a `role` argument overriding an agent's default role for just one
  call. Cost-aware defaults (DeepSeek V4.1 Flash for `researcher`/`small`)
  apply ONLY when the role table is completely empty AND the session's own
  model is a Databricks one -- documented in `docs/ROLES.md`, never
  automatic beyond that one case. `/roles` shows the resolved table (model,
  endpoint/path type, price) per role; `stats --roles` sums sub-agent spend
  per role from each Agent-tool call's own rolled-up usage node (tagged
  `role=`, additive -- a pre-V2c log simply has none).
- **Docs**: new `docs/ROLES.md`; `docs/DATABRICKS.md`'s own work-matrix
  section; `docs/COMMANDS.md`'s `work-matrix`/`--role`/`stats --roles`
  sections; `docs/SLASH-COMMANDS.md`'s `/roles` section.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-09-29

V2a: per-family Databricks correctness across every gateway type the harness
routes to (`anthropic/v1/messages`, `mlflow/v1/chat/completions`,
`cursor/v1/chat/completions`, `/serving-endpoints/<name>/invocations`), a
fixture test matrix driven by an extended `tests/helpers/mock_databricks.py`
speaking every dialect, and the two work-matrix open-question probes. See
`docs/harness/V2-brief.md`.

- **`tests/helpers/mock_databricks.py` speaks every dialect now**: the
  native `anthropic/v1/messages` gateway path is scenario-dispatched (it was
  hardcoded to one fixed "pong" reply) -- thinking blocks + signatures,
  tool_use (including Kimi's own verbatim `functions.<name>:<idx>` id), and
  the dialect's own 401/403-IP/404/overflow-400/429/5xx shapes; the
  openai-chat side gained 401/403-IP/404/500/context-overflow-400/413/
  finish_reason=length-minimal-output/Kimi-native-tool-id/cached-and-
  reasoning-token-usage/two-turn-reasoning-replay scenarios, plus path-aware
  404-then-fallback scenarios (mlflow-then-cursor, cursor-then-mlflow).
- **Per-family/per-type pinning tests** (`test_v2a_<family>_<type>_...`,
  five new files under `tests/`): Claude foundation/GLM/Kimi
  thinking+signature+cache_control+coding-agent-mode-header on the
  anthropic gateway (tested with and without thinking); DeepSeek/GPT/Grok/
  Gemini/gpt-oss reasoning decode+replay rules on mlflow; GLM's fixed
  sampling pair vs. Kimi/DeepSeek's server-fixed omission; the catalog's own
  `foundation_model.name` on the wire, `stream: true` explicit, the 32-tool
  cap + schema simplifier, and OTPM pre-admission against Kimi's real
  published rate limits; `gpt-5-5-pro`'s cursor-only route and the GPT
  family's mlflow-then-cursor fallback; Bedrock EXTERNAL Claude's
  invocations-only, model-less chat body with tool support; every error
  shape (400 unknown-field, 401, 403-IP, 404-to-exhaustion, 413,
  context-overflow-400, 429 with limit_type/retry_after, 5xx) and usage/cost
  accounting (cached + reasoning tokens, Databricks cost always "n/a", the
  catalog's DBU-rate-to-dollars conversion) per type.
- **Fix: a literal HTTP 413 is now non-retryable and classified
  `CONTEXT_WINDOW_EXCEEDED`** (`providers/errors.py`) -- `map_upstream_error`
  had no row for 413 and fell through to its own `should_retry=True`
  default, which won the `e.retryable or is_retryable_message(...)`
  short-circuit in `agent/loop.py` before `is_context_overflow_message`'s
  own (already-correct) unconditional 413-is-overflow rule ever got a
  chance to run -- a real 413 was silently retried up to `MAX_RETRIES`
  times against the identical, still-too-large body instead of surfacing as
  an overflow.
- **The two work-matrix open questions are now runnable probes**
  (`rolo_claude/work_matrix.py`, `doctor --work --probe-all --tools`): (1)
  reasoning replay after a tool call -- a real second turn, built through
  the exact same `providers.request` builders a live session uses (a
  genuinely signed `thinking` block on the anthropic dialect; the family's
  own `reasoning_echo` rule on the openai-chat dialect), is sent and its
  acceptance recorded per endpoint as `reasoning_replay_ok`; (2) route split
  from the cache -- `cached_path_type` (what `routes-cache.json` said
  before this run) alongside `path_type` (what this run actually used/
  re-cached) makes a stale-cache mismatch visible in the JSON report
  without a second run. Both fields are `None` when not applicable (no
  `--tools`, or nothing was cached yet) rather than a misleading default.
- `docs/DATABRICKS.md`/`docs/MODELS.md` updated: the work matrix's two new
  report fields, and a wording correction -- `databricks.dbu_price_usd`
  converts the catalog's own advertised DBU rate for the `/model` picker's
  informational display only; Databricks never reports a per-turn spend, so
  `/cost`/`stats` stay "n/a" regardless of whether that price is configured.
- `__version__` -> 0.7.0.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-09-29

H14: Databricks work-config parity -- zero-setup at work from Claude Code's
own settings, a generic family x api_type routing table (no vendored
endpoint list), doctor accuracy, team onboarding, and the work matrix. See
`docs/harness/H14-brief.md`.

- **Host/gateway split (scope A)**: `resolve_databricks()` now always
  returns the bare workspace root as `.host` -- a gateway path riding along
  in `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`/`DATABRICKS_HOST` (`.../ai-gateway/anthropic`) is
  split off into `.anthropic_gateway` instead of leaking into every derived
  URL. Fixes `doctor --work` building `/api/2.0/serving-endpoints` under the
  gateway path.
- **Custom headers (scope B)**: `ANTHROPIC_CUSTOM_HEADERS` (one or more
  "Name: value" lines, Claude Code's own settings.json convention) is parsed
  onto `DbxConfig.custom_headers` and merged onto every Databricks request
  (native passthrough and chat), under the default
  `x-databricks-use-coding-agent-mode: true` and any explicit override.
- **Model defaults/aliases at work (scope C)**: when Claude Code's own
  settings env resolves a Databricks config, the default model is
  `dbx:<ANTHROPIC_MODEL>` and bare `opus`/`sonnet`/`haiku` resolve through
  `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_*_MODEL` (falling back to pinned `databricks-claude-*`
  endpoints when unset) instead of the `cc:`/`ant:` subscription route or the
  OpenRouter default; `effortLevel`/`modelSettings.<id>.effortLevel` now
  actually set the session's default effort (previously unwired).
- **Generic family x api_type RULES table (scope D,
  `providers/dbx_routing.py`)**: family detected from the endpoint name (and,
  when cached, `foundation_model.name`/`model_class`) drives an ordered,
  endpoint-specific route built from the endpoint's OWN discovered
  `api_types` -- never a hand-maintained per-model list. Claude foundation
  defaults to the native anthropic gateway; GLM/Kimi default to mlflow chat
  with the anthropic gateway selectable per model (`databricks.gateway.
  <endpoint>` config or a `dbx:<endpoint>@anthropic` suffix); DeepSeek/Qwen/
  Llama/Gemma/gpt-oss default to mlflow chat, using the endpoint's real
  `foundation_model.name` as the wire model id (not a `system.ai.` prefix
  guess); GPT/Grok/Gemini default to mlflow chat, with `databricks-gpt-5-5-
  pro`'s own exception (no mlflow chat, cursor chat instead); Bedrock
  EXTERNAL Claude endpoints (`us-anthropic-claude-*`) are invocations-only
  and no longer misclassified as native Claude passthrough just because
  "claude" is in the name; a known non-chat endpoint (embeddings/whisper) is
  refused with a clear message and hidden from pickers. An unknown endpoint
  (not yet in the discovery cache) falls back to the pre-H14 static order.
- **doctor --work accuracy (scope E)**: prints the derived workspace root,
  gateway path, header NAMES (never values), default model, default effort,
  and which resolution step supplied the token; token-validity now
  distinguishes 401 (bad token), 403 with Databricks' own IP-access-list
  wording ("connect to the VPN"), 403 without it (token lacks list
  permission, inference may still work), and a wrong-path 404 -- previously
  every non-200 read as one generic "may only run inference" line. A host
  configured with no token yet still probes (a 401 without a token proves
  reachability) instead of skipping the network call.
- **Work matrix (scope H, `rolo-claude doctor --work --probe-all [--both]
  [--tools] [--only <glob>]`)**: one short pong per chat-shaped endpoint on
  its chosen path (plus the anthropic gateway too for Claude/GLM/Kimi with
  `--both`), a table of status/latency/output tokens/tool-call support, and
  a JSON report at `~/.rolo-claude/work-matrix-<date>.json` with endpoint
  names only -- no host, no token. Mock-verified (the real workspace is
  behind an IP access list from this box).
- **Team onboarding (scope I)**: a shared `team.json` (host, default model,
  per-family gateway preference, DBU price -- never a token, never an
  endpoint list) discovered at `.rolo-claude/team.json` (project),
  `~/.rolo-claude/team.json`, or `--team <path|url>`; `init --preset work`
  reads it (or Claude Code's own settings env) and asks ONLY for the token
  when a host is already known, hidden input, 0600 env file. `/model`
  groups Databricks endpoints by family, shows the chosen path type, and
  hides non-chat endpoints. `team.example.json` added.
- **`/models refresh` (alias `/dbx`) (scope J)**: re-lists the workspace
  catalog off the UI thread, updates `~/.rolo-claude/dbx-endpoints.json`, and
  reports a one-line added/removed/changed diff; `rolo-claude models
  --refresh --urls [--json]` prints the exact URL and path type per
  endpoint. Auto-refresh (`databricks.catalog_max_age_hours`, default 24h)
  on `/model` open and (silently, for an already-cached catalog only) on
  session start; an offline/403 refresh keeps the existing cache.
- `__version__` -> 0.6.0.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-09-29

H13 (RECOMMENDATIONS.md P1): lazy MCP start by default, inline images in the
terminal, `/resume` search, and the first live family-baseline pass for
GLM-5.3/Qwen/MiniMax/Kimi K2.7-code/Kimi K3. See `docs/harness/H13-brief.md`.

- **Lazy MCP by default**: every configured server is now lazy unless it's
  `alwaysLoad` or explicitly `"mcpLazy": false` (per-server, or globally via
  a new top-level `"mcpLazy": false` in `settings.json`) -- reversing the
  pre-0.5.0 "eager unless `mcpLazy: true`" default. A per-server tool cache
  under `~/.rolo-claude/mcp/tools-cache/<server>.json` (keyed by a hash of
  the server's own command/args/env/url/headers) means a lazy server's tool
  names/descriptions are still known -- and findable/preloadable -- before
  it's ever connected: no cache yet (first run, or the config changed)
  connects it once to learn its tools and writes the cache; a valid cache
  seeds a new `"cached"` handle state with zero connections. A tool call, or
  `/mcp`'s own reconnect, connects a cached/lazy server for real on demand;
  a live tool list that turns out to differ from what the cache promised
  refreshes the catalog and surfaces a short note on that same call. Status
  bar/`/mcp`/`mcp list`/`doctor` all show the new `"cached"` state (`doctor`
  additionally reports each lazy server's cache age). Every uncached server
  needing a real connect (a first run against N configured servers) does so
  CONCURRENTLY (`McpManager.start_many`), not one at a time -- a real bug
  from live dogfooding this milestone's own acceptance line surfaced before
  any fix landed (up to N times MCP_TIMEOUT, worse than the pre-0.5.0 eager
  path, which was already concurrent).
- **Inline images in the terminal**: a screenshot/image tool result renders
  inline via the kitty graphics protocol (kitty, WezTerm, Ghostty, foot) or
  sixel (other terminals, detected live), with the existing type/size/
  dimensions caption as the fallback everywhere else (no real tty, tmux
  without `allow-passthrough on`, detection finds nothing, or `images:
  "caption"`/`"off"` in `~/.rolo-claude/config.json` / `--no-inline-images`).
  `textual-image` (PyPI) was evaluated per the brief and rejected on both
  grounds it named: its own repo declares LGPL-3.0 (not permissive) and it
  requires Python >=3.12 (this project supports >=3.10) -- the kitty/sixel
  encoders are implemented directly instead (`rolo_claude/tui/images.py`);
  Pillow (the existing `vision` extra, now also `pip install rolo-claude
  [images]`) enables the sixel encoder and bounded downscaling for both
  protocols, but nothing here requires it (kitty decodes PNG/JPEG itself).
- **`/resume` search**: the session picker (TUI `/resume`, and an ambiguous/
  no-match `--resume <text>` at TUI startup -- previously silently ignored
  outside print mode, now genuinely wired through `build_session`) gets a
  live text filter, fuzzy-ranked over title/first prompt/cwd/model;
  `--resume <text>` in print mode picks the unique match or lists the
  ambiguous candidates instead of silently guessing the most recent one.
- **Family baselines**: `docs/harness/FAMILY-BASELINE-2026-09-29.md` --
  live acceptance rows for GLM-5.3, Qwen3.8 Flash, MiniMax M3, Kimi
  K2.7-code and Kimi K3 on OpenRouter (pong, a 200-line Read, a Write ->
  Edit -> Bash chain, one steer; Kimi K3 kept to the cheap pong+Read subset
  per the brief).

## [0.4.1] - 2026-09-28

H12 (RECOMMENDATIONS.md P0): the whole first run in one command, a
prescriptive `doctor`, and the cheapest fix for DeepSeek V4.1 Flash's own
telemetry-observed 8% Edit "Found multiple matches" rate. See
`docs/harness/H12-brief.md`.

- **`rolo-claude init`** (`rolo_claude/init_cli.py`): picks a preset
  (`home`/OpenRouter, `work`/Databricks, `claude`/your subscription --
  auto-detected, or `--preset`/`--yes` for non-interactive), asks for a
  missing OpenRouter key or Databricks host/token with hidden input and
  writes it into the same env file the harness already reads (POSIX mode
  0600, dir 0700, existing lines preserved, never echoed), sets
  `~/.rolo-claude/config.json`'s `model` key, runs `doctor` and `models
  --refresh`, sends a live pong, and (Linux only) offers a static `rg`
  install into `~/.local/bin` and the `~/.local/bin`-on-PATH rc-file line
  (`~/.zshenv` for zsh, `~/.profile` otherwise, behind a marker comment) --
  every step is idempotent, so re-running only ever reports the current
  state. Never touches `~/.claude.json`/`~/.claude/settings.json`, never
  prints a key/token. `~/.rolo-claude/config.json`'s `model` now sits in the
  default-model precedence chain (`--model` > `BRIDGE_MODEL`/`routes.json`
  > config.json > the built-in default) that both `-p` and the TUI resolve
  through (`model.resolve_default_model_raw`, `headless.build_session`).
- **Prescriptive `doctor`**: every `[WARN]`/`[MISSING]` line now ends with
  `-> fix: <exact command>` or `-> see: <reference>`; `doctor --json` prints
  the same checks as `{id, status, message, fix, see}` records (what `init`
  consumes for its own summary). New checks: `~/.local/bin` on PATH for a
  non-interactive shell, `tmux` mouse mode when `$TMUX` is set, configured
  MCP servers (eager vs. `mcpLazy`), and the default model in
  `config.json` plus whether its provider actually resolves.
- **Edit tool context hint** (`rolo_claude/providers/model_table.json`'s new
  `edit_hints` map, `providers/profiles.edit_hint_for`): a DeepSeek/Kimi/
  GLM/Qwen/MiniMax-family session's Edit tool description gets one extra
  line asking for at least three lines of `old_string` context, computed
  once when the frozen tool catalog is built so the wire request stays
  cache-prefix-stable; Claude/GPT sessions are unaffected, byte for byte.
- **README/INSTALL.md**: a "Quick start (Kali / Linux)" section leads the
  README now (install, `rolo-claude init`, `rolo-claude`, then Windows in
  five lines); INSTALL.md points to `init` up front.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-09-28

H11: Claude models through the user's own Claude subscription (`cc:` route)
plus first-class `ant:` aliases for the same six models via
`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`. See `docs/harness/H11-brief.md` (and the H11b fix-pass
review below, `docs/harness/review-findings-h11.md`). Binding constraint: rolo-claude never reads, copies or
replays Claude Code's OAuth credentials (`~/.claude/.credentials.json`) and
never calls `api.anthropic.com` with them -- the subscription is used the one
legitimate way, by driving the installed `claude` binary headlessly under the
user's own login, with rolo-claude's own tools exposed to it through a local
MCP bridge. rolo-claude keeps its own tools, permissions, hooks, session log
and telemetry for every `cc:` turn.

- **Aliases (`rolo_claude/providers/cc_models.py`)**: `cc:fable`/`opus`/
  `opus-5`/`opus-5.0`/`opus-4.8`/`opus-4.6`/`sonnet`/`sonnet-5`/`haiku` ->
  `claude-fable-5-1`/`claude-opus-5-5`/`claude-opus-5`/`claude-opus-5`/
  `claude-opus-4-8`/`claude-opus-4-6`/Claude Code's own `sonnet`/
  `claude-sonnet-5`/Claude Code's own `haiku`; `ant:` gets the SAME nine
  names resolved to real API ids; a bare alias with no prefix resolves to
  `cc:` (a subscription login and no `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`), `ant:` (the key
  set), or an error naming both; any full id and a trailing `[1m]` suffix
  pass through unchanged. Context/output/pricing for all nine come from a
  vendored table (OpenRouter's own `anthropic/*` catalog rows), refreshable
  live via `rolo-claude models --cc --refresh`. `doctor` and the `/model`
  picker ("Claude subscription (via Claude Code)" group) both surface this.
- **Transport (`rolo_claude/agent/cc_process.py`, `rolo_claude/ccbridge/`)**:
  one `claude -p --output-format stream-json --input-format stream-json
  --verbose --include-partial-messages --tools "" --strict-mcp-config
  --mcp-config <inline> --settings '{"disableAllHooks":true}'
  --permission-mode bypassPermissions --session-id/--resume <uuid5 of the
  rolo session id>` subprocess per `cc:` session, lazily started, stdin held
  open across turns -- every flag verified live against the installed
  claude 2.1.281/2.1.284. The `--mcp-config` names one stdio server, "rolo"
  (`python -m rolo_claude.ccbridge`), so Claude Code exposes every bridged
  tool as `mcp__rolo__<Name>`; the child forwards `tools/list`/`tools/call`
  to a `ToolBridgeServer` in the parent process (a Unix socket, mode 0600,
  on POSIX; a TCP loopback socket + a random per-session token on
  Windows) which runs the real dispatch -- permission decide, PreToolUse/
  PostToolUse hooks, the tool's own run, the session log, TUI events --
  for every call, with Claude Code's own tool_use id kept verbatim. Esc
  kills the subprocess (process group, no orphans) and synthesizes
  interrupted results for anything still in flight; the next turn restarts
  with `--resume`. A steer sends its line to the running subprocess
  immediately (Claude Code queues it on its own). Switching models into
  `cc:` mid-session primes the new subprocess with the prior log as one
  `<conversation-so-far>` message; switching away needs nothing special
  (every `cc:` turn already logged ordinary user/assistant/tool_result
  nodes). `stats --models`/`/cost` show `cc:` rows with `total_cost_usd`
  marked as Claude Code's own estimate, never real per-token billing.
- **Tests**: `tests/helpers/fake_claude_cc.py` (a scripted `claude` stand-in
  that also acts as a REAL MCP client against the real `ccbridge` child) plus
  `tests/test_cc_models.py`, `tests/test_ccbridge_server.py`,
  `tests/test_cc_session.py` -- 53 tests covering alias resolution, the
  bridge's own wire protocol (both transports), lazy start/reuse/kill,
  tools/list parity with the frozen catalog, deny rules, a live interactive
  permission card, hooks firing exactly once, pairing invariants across an
  Esc mid-call, the `estimate` usage flag, `--resume` after a restart and
  after a fresh `--continue`-shaped process, steering, a cc:<->or: model
  switch, and the credentials file never being opened.

### H11b fix pass (same 0.4.0 milestone, no version bump)

A 28-finding review of the H11 work above (2 critical, 12 major, 14 minor --
`docs/harness/review-findings-h11.md`) found the `cc:` route's steering
accounting could hang a turn forever, and the `claude` subprocess inherited
this process's whole environment (provider keys, an outer Claude Code
session's own identity) instead of a stripped one. Both are fixed, along
with the rest of the findings:

- **Steering (critical)**: `claude` now runs with `--replay-user-messages`;
  every stdin line is tracked in a FIFO until its own `isReplay` echo
  confirms claude actually consumed it, and a turn ends at a `result` only
  once that FIFO is empty -- correct whether a steer is absorbed into the
  turn already running (one result covers both) or answered as its own
  follow-up turn (queued lines get a combined reply). A steer is logged
  only once consumed, never at send time.
- **Child environment (critical)**: the `claude` subprocess and its MCP
  child now get `tool_child_env()` minus every `ANTHROPIC_*`/`CLAUDE_CODE_*`
  variable and `CLAUDECODE` -- an ambient API key, base URL or an outer
  session's own identity never reaches it. Doctor and `cc:` now refuse to
  report "available" unless `claude auth status`, checked in that same
  stripped environment, reports `authMethod: claude.ai`.
- **The bridge's dispatch is now the loop's own dispatch**: EnterPlanMode/
  ExitPlanMode, AskUserQuestion, and Agent/Task (streamed live, a child's
  own permission ask reaching the same card the parent's calls use) all
  reuse `Session._resolve_tool_call`/`_finalize_tool_result` directly
  instead of a separate, partial re-implementation -- always-allow rules,
  PreToolUse/PermissionRequest/PermissionDenied hooks and the loop breaker
  now all apply to bridged calls too. Images now flow both ways (a pasted
  image reaches claude in the stream-json message; a bridged tool's image
  result reaches claude as a real MCP `ImageContent`, never "[image
  block]"). `--append-system-prompt` now carries a real addendum (skills
  index, subagent_type list, MCP server instructions, deferred-tool names,
  the plan-mode note, and a sub-agent's own body). Background-job/sub-agent
  notices and a `UserPromptSubmit` hook's context are sent to claude, not
  just logged; Stop hooks fire on `result`.
- **MCP catalog growth**: the bridge sends a real
  `notifications/tools/list_changed` (a long-poll on a dedicated
  connection) when ToolSearch grows the session's catalog, so Claude Code
  can discover and call a tool that loaded mid-session.
- **Session identity**: the cc conversation id is logged in a `meta` node;
  `/clear` drops it (a fresh conversation); `/fork` and a `cc:` model
  change close the live process and restart with `--resume`/
  `--fork-session`; a `--resume` claude rejects ("No conversation found"/
  "already in use") falls back to a fresh `--session-id` primed with the
  prior log instead of surfacing the error.
- **Accounting and errors**: `total_cost_usd` (cumulative per claude
  process) is now logged as the per-turn delta, never double-counted. An
  error-shaped result (no stream deltas) now becomes a real error event,
  a non-zero `-p` exit and an `is_error` result; an unconnected bridge MCP
  server gets a warning instead of silently leaving claude with no tools.
- **Lifecycle**: a sub-agent's own claude subprocess/bridge/socket closes
  when its call ends (not just at process quit); an old bridge is closed
  before a restart replaces it; a tool call's result is paired with its
  tool_use even if the bridge's own dispatch raises.
- **Command-line budget (found by this pass's own live acceptance, not in
  the review)**: the `--append-system-prompt` addendum rides on claude's
  own command line, which on Windows goes through `claude.CMD` -> cmd.exe;
  a real dev box with a dozen verbosely-described skills hit "The command
  line is too long" and the subprocess never started. Every discovered
  skill/agent/MCP description is clipped and the whole addendum is capped
  (~3.5K chars) -- a short hint beats a session that cannot start.
- **Tests**: `tests/test_cc_session.py` grew from 21 to 46 (steer absorbed
  between tool calls / two steers queued behind a turn, the stripped child
  env, plan tools, AskUserQuestion, streamed Agent + a child's live ask,
  images both ways, notices/hook context, `list_changed`, the logged cc
  session id, `/clear`, `/fork`, resume fallback, a cc:->cc: model switch,
  per-turn cost delta, error results, Stop hooks, child close, and --
  POSIX only -- pgrep/SIGHUP orphan checks); `test_tui.py` gained a real
  Textual pilot of a `cc:` session's PermissionCard (46 -> 47); each cc:
  test module now sets its own scratch home, and
  `tests/test_bash_background_jobs.py` restores `BRIDGE_TEST_HOME`.
- Corrected this changelog's own "per-connection token" (it's per-session)
  and "`/compact` no-op" (now a real one, not a failure) claims from
  earlier in this same entry.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-09-25

H10: free L0 telemetry from the existing session logs, plus a human-gated
`/improve` (L1 memory/rules + L3 skills). See `docs/harness/H10-brief.md`. Nothing here lets a model edit its
own instructions silently -- every written artifact is approved on a card
or an explicit headless `--apply`; provenance is information shown on the
card, never a block or a classifier; nothing drafts or writes in `-p`;
nothing interrupts a running turn, auto mode included (status-bar/toast
hint only). Settings tuning, prompt optimisation and code self-edits were
explicitly declined and are not built.

- **Telemetry (`rolo_claude/telemetry.py`)**: `rolo-claude stats [--models]
  [--tools] [--since 7d|30d|all] [--all-projects] [--session ID] [--json]`
  and `/stats --models` in the TUI (run off the UI thread, same worker
  pattern as `/resume`'s session list) aggregate per-(model,provider) and
  per-tool counters -- tokens/cost, avg ttft/latency, `finish=length`%,
  retries/status codes, overflows, tool-call/error rates, repair-hit% by
  kind, edit-failure%, steers/interrupts/compactions/loop-breaker trips --
  entirely from non-wire metadata added to existing `usage`/`assistant`/
  `tool_result` session-log nodes (never a new model-visible field; proved
  with byte-identical derived-request tests across both the OpenAI-dialect
  and native-Anthropic wire bodies). Results cache in
  `~/.rolo-claude/stats-cache.json` keyed by (path, size, mtime); a corrupt
  log line is skipped and counted, never a crash. `doctor` now shows the
  sessions count, cache age and the active `/improve` config.
- **`/improve` (`rolo_claude/improve/`)**: clusters recent failures from the
  telemetry scan (repeated tool errors, repair-layer hits, loop-breaker
  trips, user corrections, Read ENOENT/wrong-cwd, a tool sequence recurring
  across sessions), drafts up to `improve.max_candidates` (8) candidates
  with ONE model call (config `improve.model` -> the small model -> the
  session model), and reviews them one `ImproveCard` at a time (`a` apply,
  `e` edit in `$VISUAL`/`$EDITOR` then apply, `s` skip, `d` dismiss forever,
  `q` stop). A memory candidate writes Claude Code's exact frontmatter
  shape plus a MEMORY.md index line; a rule writes `.claude/rules/*.md`
  (or `~/.claude/rules/`); a skill ships with `disable-model-invocation:
  true`. Only new files are created unless the target already carries the
  `<!-- rolo-claude improve: ... -->` provenance comment (a collision with
  a user-authored file picks a new name instead). Applying appends an
  `improve_applied` log node and refreshes the next turn's CLAUDE.md/
  memory-index snapshot (same mechanism as post-compaction re-injection).
  A session's own counters crossing `improve.hint_threshold` shows a
  one-time, counters-only hint -- never a model call, never a card.
  Headless: `rolo-claude improve [--since] [--all-projects] [--json]
  [--out FILE]` and `rolo-claude improve --apply FILE#ID` (repeatable);
  `-p` never drafts or writes; `--bare` disables it entirely.
- **Config**: `~/.rolo-claude/config.json`'s new `improve` key (`enabled`,
  `hint`, `model`, `since_days`, `max_candidates`, `hint_threshold`),
  settable with dotted paths (`rolo-claude config set improve.model
  or:...`).

## [0.3.0] - 2026-09-25

`rolo-claude` becomes its own standalone, Claude-Code-compatible agent
harness: its own agent loop, built-in tools, permission engine, MCP client
and TUI, reading Claude Code's real config files unchanged and driving
OpenRouter/Databricks-hosted open-weight models (DeepSeek, Kimi, GLM, Qwen,
MiniMax, ...) instead of an Anthropic subscription. Kali Linux is the
primary target platform; Windows is the build/test host. The original
`claude-bridge` proxy (drives the real `claude` binary against the same
providers) is kept unchanged as the `rolo-claude proxy` subcommand.

Built up over milestones H0-H9 (plus U0/U2/U5 for the TUI) -- see
`docs/harness/README.md` for the full per-milestone brief/review index:

- **H0-H1 -- foundation and provider layer**: package split from the
  `bridge.py` proxy; per-provider compat profiles (OpenAI-chat dialect +
  native Anthropic-Messages passthrough); append-only JSONL session log as
  the single source of truth, with "model-visible means logged" enforced by
  a runtime invariant; reasoning replay per model family
  (`reasoning_content`/`reasoning_details`/thinking blocks); explicit
  `max_tokens` budgeting; the cumulative per-turn loop breaker (remind 3 /
  deny 5 / end turn 8).
- **H2 -- built-in tools, repair, permissions**: Read/Write/Edit/Bash/
  PowerShell/Glob/Grep/WebFetch/TodoWrite/AskUserQuestion and friends; a
  tool-call repair layer for weaker models (fenced/leaked calls promoted to
  real `tool_use`); the full Claude Code permission-rule grammar (deny/ask/
  allow, modes, Bash sub-command matching, path globs) with **no safety
  classifier, destructive-command list or protected-path heuristic
  anywhere** -- `auto` allows everything not matched by the user's own
  deny/ask rules, exactly as decided up front.
- **H3/H3b/H3c -- MCP**: the official MCP SDK, stdio/http/sse transports,
  frozen per-session tool catalog with lazy `ToolSearch` loading (parallel
  and abortable as of H9), `--chrome`/`--playwright` browser tools, plugin-
  provided servers, the `mcp` CLI.
- **H4 -- hooks, skills, commands, web**: every Claude Code hook event and
  handler type (`command`/`prompt`/`agent`/`http`/`mcp_tool`); skills and
  custom slash commands from user/project directories; WebFetch/WebSearch;
  **uninterrupted auto mode with mid-turn steering** (Esc is the only hard
  stop; typing during a turn queues a steer that's applied at the next
  chunk boundary; nothing may say an action "isn't allowed in auto mode").
- **H5/H5b/H5c -- compaction, native Anthropic routes, reliability
  hardening**: auto-compaction (OpenCode-style pruning + an 8-section
  checkpoint summary, floored trigger so small-context models still
  compact sanely, never back-to-back); native `ant:`/Databricks-Claude
  thinking replay with signatures; two full review passes (H4/H5/H3c, then
  H5b) closing 18 and then 19 findings covering steer/abort races, hook
  interruptibility, sub-agent permission surfacing, `SessionStart` env-file
  handling, and stream-json mid-turn steering.
- **H6/U5 -- sub-agents, plan mode, resume, TUI polish**: the `Agent`/
  `Task` tool with a worker pool, background sub-agents, plan mode
  (`EnterPlanMode`/`ExitPlanMode`, a plan file, TUI `PlanCard`), session
  resume/fork/rename, chords + a which-key overlay, `/rewind`, `/export
  --sanitize`, `/stats`.
- **H8 -- background jobs, vision, packaging**: `Bash(run_in_background)` +
  `BashOutput`/`TaskStop`; image/vision support (Read, MCP tool results,
  `@path`, `--file`) with captioned tool cards; `NotebookEdit`; catalog
  vendoring (`models --refresh`, a package-vendored offline fallback);
  offline work-box installs (`tools/vendor_wheels.py`); a full README
  rewrite.
- **H9 -- bug hunt, Linux-first acceptance, MCP compatibility, release**:
  whole-tree review; Linux-first acceptance of every milestone's acceptance
  lines (WSL Ubuntu; the Kali VM when reachable); an MCP compatibility
  matrix (user/project/local/plugin scopes, `claude mcp add` <->
  `rolo-claude mcp add` interop, unusual tool schemas surviving OpenRouter
  and the Databricks 32-tool/no-`$ref` simplifier, `/mcp` reconnect,
  http/sse transports); a randomised fuzz harness (malformed streams,
  unicode edge cases, interrupts/steers at every event boundary, 429/5xx
  storms) asserting log-integrity invariants hold with no hangs or leaked
  threads/processes; a period-2 ("ping-pong") doom-loop detector layered on
  the existing per-call breaker; `doctor` checks for `rg`, `$VISUAL`/
  `$EDITOR` and a usable Bash shell; the `ToolSearch`-triggered lazy MCP
  start made parallel and abortable; a sampling-table audit (temperature/
  top_p/top_k per model family) against the open-weight adapter research,
  plus wiring `sampling_unsupported_params` from `model_table.json` into
  the actual request body instead of leaving it decorative; four dead
  `model_table.json` rows recovered (a JSON key had explanatory prose baked
  into it, so `qwen/qwen3-max`, `qwen/qwen3-max-thinking`, a Mistral batch
  variant and a Databricks Llama row could never resolve their real,
  tuned settings); `type: http` MCP servers connect again (a 3-tuple
  unpack against an SDK that yields 2); `/mcp` reconnect re-reads
  `~/.claude.json`/`.mcp.json` so an edited or brand-new server is picked
  up mid-session (`McpManager.resync_from`); progress notifications can
  actually keep a long MCP call alive (the SDK's own non-resettable
  timeout no longer races the keepalive); a family-agnostic MCP tool-
  schema normaliser (local `$ref` inlining, tuple-items, nullable
  `anyOf`) for every OpenAI-shaped family, not just Kimi/Gemini; the
  Databricks simplifier keeps a typed fallback for a wide `anyOf`;
  `rolo-claude mcp add` writes the same `"env": {}` the real binary does;
  `rolo-claude proxy launch` finds a native POSIX `claude` (it only ever
  looked for the Windows shims -- a crash on Kali, the primary platform);
  a PreToolUse hook written in the PermissionRequest `decision.behavior`
  shape is honoured instead of silently ignored; `--playwright` fails
  fast without a runnable `node`; Kimi `functions.{name}:{idx}` tool ids
  continue across the whole session instead of restarting per call;
  parallel sub-agents with colliding tool_use ids get distinct permission
  waiters; a missing `Path` import in `providers/http.py`.
- **H9b -- whole-tree review fix pass**: closed the review's remaining 24
  findings plus several "NEW from H9" cleanup items, all with real-Session
  or real-CLI pinning tests. Background jobs/sub-agents as one contract: a
  sub-agent's own `JobRegistry` is shared with (and killed by) its parent;
  `-p` now handles SIGHUP the same as SIGTERM (an `atexit kill_all` safety
  net too), verified with `pgrep` on WSL AND the Kali VM that both a
  background Bash job and an MCP stdio server subprocess are gone after a
  normal exit and after SIGHUP; a resume/`TaskOutput` on a task_id whose
  background child is still writing its own log is refused instead of
  racing it, and `AgentRuntime.tasks` is rebuilt from each child's own
  `meta.json` on a `-c` resume instead of coming back "Unknown"; a child's
  usage/cost rolls up into the parent's own CostMeter/log/`--max-budget-
  usd`/`stats`; a child's error/max_turns/blocked outcome is carried onto
  its ToolResult instead of handing back stale text as if it finished
  normally. Secrets: ONE sanitizer (`sk-or-v1-`/`sk-ant-`/`dapi`/`ghp_`,
  quoted `export KEY="…"`, JSON env blocks, Bearer headers) now backs both
  `export --sanitize` and the TUI's `/export --sanitize`; the dead,
  never-wired `session_cli.py` sanitizer is deleted; `CLAUDE_ENV_FILE` is
  sourced against the already-stripped `tool_child_env`, not raw
  `os.environ`. Linux PATH: a Debian/Kali `/etc/profile` login shell no
  longer discards the session's own PATH (foreground and background Bash
  alike), verified with the `unshare -rm` bind-mounted-profile trick on
  WSL. TUI: parallel children stream into their own grouped blocks (keyed
  by agent_id/turn/seq) and never touch the parent's status bar, cost or
  `on_turn_done`; `@server:resource` mention resolution is regex-first,
  runs off the UI thread with a cache and a content cap, so a hung/slow
  MCP server can no longer freeze prompt submission. Also: pre-4.5
  notebooks (no cell ids) accept positional `cell-N` addressing and clear
  stale outputs on a code-cell replace; `turn()`'s own `finally` drains
  queued `@mention`/`!cmd` writes before the next prompt, and manual
  `/compact`/`/clear` count as busy for log-write queuing; a truncated
  Read's continuation hint is computed from the actual last included line,
  on a line boundary; image media type comes from sniffing the real bytes,
  not the file extension, and only the two HARD limits (8000px/5MB) gate
  omission without Pillow -- a plain screenshot under the old 1568px soft
  threshold is no longer omitted for nothing; image offload counts real
  prompts only, never a tool_result's own wire message; a spilled tool
  result's continuation hint is Read-allowed under the session's own
  `tool-results/` dir in every permission mode; Databricks default model
  rows (DeepSeek V4.1 Flash, Kimi K3, GLM 5.3) resolve their real
  1M-token context instead of a generic 128k/16k fallback; offline
  packaging installs cleanly on a bare Python >=3.12 venv (setuptools no
  longer assumed preinstalled) and vendors cp313 wheels too; `bin/rolo-
  claude` resolves a symlink (`readlink -f`) instead of failing outside
  the checkout; a `ucode-settings.json` shaped like a Claude Code
  `--settings` file (an `env` block, or an `apiKeyHelper` command) now
  resolves too, not just the gateway-config key spellings; `/stats`/
  `stats` count real prompts only (never a notice/steer/Stop-continuation)
  and report cache-read/cache-creation tokens; a background-job offset/
  lock race that could duplicate or drop BashOutput text after a timeout
  hand-off is fixed; `doctor` accepts the real minimum Python (3.10, not
  3.9) and `--work` probes the actually-configured model with the
  production header instead of the first DeepSeek/Kimi/GLM endpoint it
  finds. Plus: every temp directory a test creates is tracked and cleaned
  up at the end of a `run_all.py` invocation; `python -X dev -W
  error::ResourceWarning tests/run_all.py` is clean (several unclosed
  HTTP connections and subprocess pipes fixed, without reintroducing the
  Windows orphaned-grandchild hang a naive synchronous `.close()` caused);
  a `ruff check --select F,E9,B` pass across `rolo_claude/`/`tests/`
  (dead imports/locals, unused loop variables, explicit `zip(strict=)`,
  explicit exception chaining); confirmed `wip/` is already excluded from
  the built wheel.

`__version__` is `0.3.0` (`rolo_claude/__init__.py`); see
`docs/harness/ACCEPTANCE-2026-09-25.md` for the full Linux/Windows
acceptance record and `docs/harness/review-findings-*.md` for the detailed
per-finding review history behind the H1-H5c/H9b entries above.

## [0.2.1] - claude-bridge (pre-standalone-harness)

The original `claude-bridge`: a single-file, stdlib-only HTTP proxy
(`bridge.py`) that sits in front of the real `claude` binary and translates
its Anthropic-Messages-API calls to OpenRouter or Databricks, leaving
`claude`'s own subscription, config, memory, MCP servers, skills, hooks and
permissions untouched. Kept unchanged as `rolo-claude proxy` (97 tests).
