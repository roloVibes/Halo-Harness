# Configuration

Exactly which files this harness reads (Claude Code's own config, unchanged)
and which it owns (its own small state under `~/.halo/`), how they're
merged, every environment variable, and precisely what is never written.
Permissions/hooks *behavior* (as opposed to where their config lives) is
covered in [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md); Databricks credential
discovery specifically is covered in [DATABRICKS.md](DATABRICKS.md).

## Claude Code files -- read only, never written (except where noted)

### `settings.json` precedence

Five layers, later wins, merged by `config/settings.py::resolve_settings`:

| Layer | Path | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `policySettings` (managed) | `C:\Program Files\ClaudeCode\managed-settings.json` (Windows) / `/etc/claude-code/managed-settings.json` / `/Library/Application Support/ClaudeCode/managed-settings.json`, plus every `*.json` under a sibling `managed-settings.d/` | highest precedence, always read, never trust-gated |
| `flagSettings` | `--settings` (inline JSON or a file path) | second-highest |
| `localSettings` | `<cwd>/.claude/settings.local.json` | |
| `projectSettings` | `<cwd>/.claude/settings.json` | |
| `userSettings` | `~/.claude/settings.json` (`$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` if set) | lowest precedence |

`--setting-sources` restricts which of `user`/`project`/`local` are read at
all (`policySettings`/`flagSettings` are always included). Merge rules,
applied key by key across the whole stack: most scalar keys are plain
highest-layer-wins; a **list**-valued key is concatenated across every layer
that set it and de-duplicated (order-preserving) -- *unless* the
highest-precedence layer that touched it set something else entirely
(a scalar), in which case that wins outright, never merged; `env` and
`hooks` are always accumulated (a lower layer's own hook/env entry is never
discarded by a higher layer setting more); `permissions.allow/ask/deny/
additionalDirectories` follow the same list-concatenation rule, scoped to
that one sub-object. `fallbackModel`/`modelPicker`/`availableModels`/
`modelSettings` are whole-value, highest-layer-wins, never merged field by
field.

**Trust**: an *untrusted* `project`/`local` layer has `permissions.allow`,
`permissions.additionalDirectories`, `env`, `hooks`, and
`autoMemoryDirectory` stripped before merging -- `permissions.deny`/`.ask`
always survive regardless of trust (a repo you haven't trusted yet can still
have its own denials honored, just never its own extra permissions/secrets/
hooks). Trust itself (`config/claude_json.py::is_trusted`) is true when any
of: `projects[cwd].hasTrustDialogAccepted` for `cwd` or an ancestor up to
the git root (or the filesystem root if not in a repo); `CLAUDE_CODE_SANDBOXED`
is set to any non-empty value; or `~/.halo/trust.json` has an entry
for the normalized cwd (this harness's own trust store -- written by a
future trust-prompt flow, not yet interactive).

### Permissions and hooks

The rule grammar, mode table, and hook protocol are architecture, not
config -- see `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`'s "Permissions" and "Hooks protocol"
sections. Configuration-relevant summary: `permissions.allow`/`.ask`/`.deny`
live inside `settings.json` at every layer above; hooks live in that same
file's top-level `hooks` key at every layer (concatenated, never
overridden -- every matching hook from every layer runs); a plugin's own
`hooks/hooks.json` is a separate, additional source, with
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` substituted first. There is no separate freestanding
`hooks.json` for an ordinary user/project outside a plugin.

### CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md / rules / memory

Discovery order (`config/claude_md.py::discover_instructions`; `bare`/
`--bare` skips this whole section): managed `CLAUDE.md` (never excluded,
always loaded) -> `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` + `~/.claude/rules/**/*.md` -> a
root-to-leaf walk of every ancestor directory from the filesystem root down
to `cwd` (root itself excluded), at each one: `CLAUDE.md` and/or
`.claude/CLAUDE.md`, then `AGENTS.md`/`.claude/AGENTS.md` if
`instructionFiles` calls for it (see below), then that ancestor's own
`.claude/rules/**/*.md`, then `CLAUDE.local.md`. A `.claude/rules/*.md` file
with a `paths:` frontmatter glob is **scoped** -- held back and only
injected the first time a matching file is Read/Edited/Globbed this
session, rather than loaded unconditionally at launch like an ordinary
`CLAUDE.md`. `@path`/`@~/path`/`@//abs/path` imports inside any of these
files are expanded recursively (max 4 hops, 4 MiB per file, cycle-safe); an
import outside `cwd`/`~/.claude` from an **untrusted** project is skipped
with a warning, never silently included.

`settings.instructionFiles` (really
`pluginConfigs.<the agents-md plugin>.options.instructionFiles`, with a
legacy top-level `projectInstructions` mapping onto the same four values)
picks the `CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md` policy per ancestor: `managed-only`
(nothing below the managed tier), `claude-md` (never read `AGENTS.md`),
`claude-md-or-agents-md` (the default -- `AGENTS.md` only where no
`CLAUDE.md` was found at that ancestor), or `claude-md-and-agents-md`
(both, always). `claudeMdExcludes` (a glob list) removes specific files from
this whole walk regardless of policy.

**Memory** (`config/memory.py`): the directory is
`~/.claude/projects/<slug-of-the-git-root-or-cwd>/memory/`, unless
`settings.autoMemoryDirectory` overrides it (that key is **never** honored
from an untrusted, or any, `projectSettings` layer -- policy/flag/local/user
only). `MEMORY.md` there is the index (capped at 200 lines / 25,000 bytes
when injected into a session, truncated with a marker beyond that); every
sibling `*.md` is a topic file, indexed by its own frontmatter
`name`/`description`/`type`/`modified` (checked at the top level first, a
nested `metadata:` block overriding per-key if present). `autoMemoryEnabled`
(default true) and `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_AUTO_MEMORY=1` both disable it
entirely.

### Skills, custom commands, agents

- **Skills**: `~/.claude/skills/`, `.claude/skills/`, one `SKILL.md` per
  directory. `disable-model-invocation: true` hides a skill from the
  model's own Skill *tool* only -- a user can still always type `/name`.
- **Custom commands**: `~/.claude/commands/`, `.claude/commands/`, one
  `.md` file per command. See `docs/SLASH-COMMANDS.md` for the shared
  `$ARGUMENTS`/`` !`cmd` ``/`@path` body-expansion pipeline both of these
  (and skills) go through.
- **Agents** (`config/agents_md.py::discover_agents`), nearest-wins within
  each tier, later tier overrides an earlier one by `name`: three built-ins
  (`general-purpose`, `Explore`, `Plan`) -> `~/.claude/agents/**/*.md` ->
  every `.claude/agents/**/*.md` walking from `cwd` up to the git root
  (nearest directory wins) -> `--agents` (inline JSON or a file) -> plugin
  `agents/**/*.md` -> managed `agents/**/*.md` (highest). Frontmatter
  `tools:`/`disallowedTools:`/`skills:` accept a comma string or a YAML
  list; `model:` resolves invocation override -> frontmatter -> env
  `CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL`/`settings.subagentModel` -> the parent
  session's own model (`haiku` maps to the parent's *small* model
  specifically); a bare `Agent`/`Task` tools entry (or `Agent(name)`/
  `Task(name)`) restricts which `subagent_type`s that agent may itself
  invoke.

### Plans, keybindings, `~/.claude.json`, `.mcp.json`, plugins

- **Plans**: `~/.claude/plans/` by default, or `settings.plansDirectory`.
- **Keybindings**: `~/.claude/keybindings.json`, merged additively onto the
  built-in defaults (see `docs/SLASH-COMMANDS.md`).
- **`~/.claude.json`**: trust dialog state (`projects[cwd].
  hasTrustDialogAccepted`), user-scope `mcpServers`, and
  `projects[cwd].mcpServers` (local-scope MCP servers) -- read on every
  session; **written only by `halo mcp add`/`add-json`/`remove`**
  (see `docs/COMMANDS.md`), which preserve the file's own existing indent
  width, trailing newline, BOM, and every key they don't touch, exactly
  matching what the real `claude mcp add`/`remove` would do. No other code
  path in this harness ever writes this file.
- **`.mcp.json`** (project-scope MCP servers): read from `<cwd>/.mcp.json`;
  a server there needs first-time approval (`enabledMcpjsonServers`/
  `enableAllProjectMcpServers` in `~/.claude.json` or settings, or a
  print-mode run, or a prior approval recorded in
  `~/.halo/mcp-approvals.json`) before it's ever started.
- **Plugins**: `~/.claude/plugins/installed_plugins.json` (both the V1
  single-dict and the real V2 per-scope-array manifest shapes), each
  enabled plugin's own `.mcp.json`/`.claude-plugin/plugin.json` (MCP
  servers) and `hooks/hooks.json` (hooks), with `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`
  expanded to that plugin's own install directory.

## Codex CLI files -- read only, never written

Halo 2.0.3 round 5i part 2 (`providers/codex_settings.py`,
`providers/settings_merge.py`). Read for `/settings`/`halo doctor`'s
`codex_settings` line/the init wizard's "Settings sources" step only --
never consulted when building a request for any OTHER route, and a
`cx:` session's actual execution reads these files itself (Codex loads
its own config/AGENTS.md the moment `codex exec` starts, same as Claude
Code does for a `cc:` session), so there is nothing to feed it from here
either.

- **`config.toml`**: `$CODEX_HOME/config.toml` (`CODEX_HOME` defaults to
  `~/.codex`), with `<project-root>/.codex/config.toml` layered over it
  for a trusted project. Parsed by a small hand-rolled reader (this repo
  ships no TOML dependency) that handles plain `key = value` scalars and
  `[table]`/`[table.sub]` headers -- enough for the documented keys
  (`model`, `model_provider`, `model_reasoning_effort`, `approval_policy`,
  `sandbox_mode`, `mcp_servers.<name>`, `profiles.<name>`,
  `shell_environment_policy`, `notify`, `history`), not a full TOML
  implementation; an unparseable line is skipped, never raised.
- **`AGENTS.md` chain**: `$CODEX_HOME/AGENTS.override.md` else
  `$CODEX_HOME/AGENTS.md` (global, first non-empty wins), then the SAME
  override-or-plain rule walked from the git repository root down to the
  working directory, concatenated root-to-leaf, capped at
  `project_doc_max_bytes` (32 KiB default). A DIFFERENT walk than Halo's
  own CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md loader (`config/claude_md.py`, a filesystem-root
  walk with no git-root concept) -- kept as its own, separate reader since
  the two rules genuinely differ; see `docs/MODELS.md`'s "Codex settings
  and instructions" section.
- **`.codex/config.toml`**: a project's own scoped config (MCP servers,
  mainly), read the same way as the home one and layered over it.

## halo's own files

None of these are read by Claude Code; nothing here is ever confused with
the files above.

| Path | Holds |
|---|---|
| `~/.halo/config.json` | this harness's own settings -- see the key table below |
| `~/.config/halo/env` (`HALO_ENV_FILE`/legacy `BRIDGE_ENV_FILE` to override) | `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`/`DATABRICKS_HOST`/`DATABRICKS_TOKEN` etc., `KEY=value` lines, `#` comments, optional `export`; written mode 0600, dir 0700 (POSIX) by `halo init`. The PRE-2.0.0 location, `~/.config/vibes-hacker/env`, was read as a fallback through 2.0.4 (announced in the [2.0.1] CHANGELOG, WARNed by `halo doctor` since [2.0.2]) -- as of 2.0.5 round 3 it is no longer read at all; `halo init` still copies it forward into this file (with an import marker, one time) the first time it writes here, so nothing already configured there is lost, and the legacy file itself is never modified or deleted (other tools on the same box may still read it). |
| `~/.halo/learned-rules.json` | per-endpoint learned facts, keyed `"<provider>:<model>"`: `tools_rejected` (24h TTL), `reasoning_effort_with_tools`, `ignored_params` (the `xp:` gateway's disclosed-ignored-parameters header), `mcp_fix`, and `params` (Halo 2.0.5: `{"<field>": {"action": "drop"\|"clamp", "value", "error", "date"}}`, one entry per request field a live 400/422 proved this endpoint rejects -- 30-day TTL; `halo rules`/`/rules` lists these, `halo rules --forget <endpoint>`/`halo models refresh --forget-rules` clear them; see `docs/COMMANDS.md`) |
| `~/.halo/sessions/<project-slug>/<id>.jsonl` | one append-only session log per session (see `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`) |
| `~/.halo/sessions/<project-slug>/index.json` | per-session title/first-prompt/turns/cost, for `/resume`'s picker and `-r <text>` |
| `~/.halo/models.json`, `dbx-endpoints.json`, `models-dev.json`, `cc-models.json` | cached model catalogs (`docs/MODELS.md`) |
| `~/.halo/ollama-capabilities.json` | the `ol:` capability probe's durable cache, keyed by model digest (`docs/MODELS.md`'s "Ollama" section) -- the `/api/tags`+`/api/show` catalog itself is cached in memory only, short TTL, never written to disk |
| `~/.halo/stats-cache.json` | telemetry aggregation cache, keyed by (path, size, mtime) |
| `~/.halo/mcp/tools-cache/<server>.json`, `~/.halo/mcp/<server>.log` | a lazy MCP server's cached tool list, and its stderr |
| `~/.halo/mcp-approvals.json` | remembered `.mcp.json` server approvals |
| `~/.halo/mcp/connectors.json` | cached claude.ai connectors (name/url/status/tools) discovered through `claude mcp list` -- see `docs/COMMANDS.md`'s "claude.ai connectors bridge" section |
| `~/.halo/mcp/oauth/<server-name>.json` | `halo mcp login`'s own OAuth tokens for one remote (http/sse) MCP server -- never written to any Claude Code file |
| `~/.halo/trust.json` | this harness's own trust-dialog store |
| `~/.halo/history.jsonl` | this harness's own prompt history (merged with Claude Code's own `~/.claude/history.jsonl` at read time, never written to) |
| `~/.halo/improve/dismissed.json`, `~/.halo/improve/<ts>.json` | `/improve` dismissed-candidate hashes, and saved candidate batches |
| `~/.halo/work-matrix-<date>.json` | `doctor --work --probe-all` reports (endpoint names only, never a host or token) |
| `~/.halo/sessions/<slug>/<id>/shadow/`, `shadow-index.jsonl` | `/rewind`'s git-shadow snapshots |
| `<state_dir>/routes.json` | optional, proxy-era per-box defaults (`aliases`, `default`/`small` model, per-model `profiles`) -- still read by the harness's own default-model resolution chain; see `routes.example.json` |
| `.halo/team.json` (project) or `~/.halo/team.json` | shared Databricks team preset -- see `docs/DATABRICKS.md` |
| `~/.halo/agents/<name>.yaml` (`.halo/agents/<name>.yaml` project) | an agent BIO -- models/tools/context/limits/output/environment/acceptance for one named agent; see [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) |
| `~/.halo/teams/<name>.yaml` (`.halo/teams/<name>.yaml` project) | a TEAM TEMPLATE ("lineup") -- assigns agent bios to roles/positions; `team` (below) names the active one; see [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) |

### `~/.halo/config.json` keys

Read/written with `halo config get/set` (dotted paths supported) or
directly by the features that own them:

| Key | Default | Set by |
|---|---|---|
| `model` | unset (built-in default applies) | `halo init`, `halo config set model ...` |
| `team` | unset (no active team template) | `halo teams use <name>` -- see [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) |
| `theme` | auto-detected from terminal truecolor support | `/theme`, `halo config set theme ...` |
| `images` | `"inline"` | `--no-inline-images` overrides per-run |
| `intro` | `true` | `--no-intro` overrides per-run; set `false` to turn off the launch intro for good |
| `mcpPreload` | unset | hand-edited: a list of wire tool names to preload regardless of the catalog's own `alwaysLoad` rule |
| `compactionModel` | unset (uses the session model) | hand-edited |
| `databricks.gateway.<endpoint>` | unset | `halo init --provider databricks` (from a team.json `gateway_preference`), or hand-edited |
| `databricks.dbu_price_usd` | unset (costs show as raw DBUs) | team.json, or hand-edited |
| `databricks.catalog_max_age_hours` | `24` | hand-edited |
| `improve.enabled` | `true` | hand-edited |
| `improve.hint` | `true` | hand-edited |
| `improve.model` | unset (small model, then session model) | `halo config set improve.model or:...` |
| `improve.since_days` | `7` | hand-edited |
| `improve.max_candidates` | `8` (hard-capped at 8) | hand-edited |
| `improve.hint_threshold.{repairs,edit_failures,loop_breaker}` | `3`/`2`/`1` | hand-edited |
| `connectors.bridge` | `true` | `halo config set connectors.bridge false` disables claude.ai connector discovery and every `connector__<slug>` tool outright |
| `connectors.<slug>.enabled` | `true` | hand-edited; `false` removes just that one connector's tool |
| `connectors.<slug>.alwaysLoad` | `false` | hand-edited; preloads that connector's tool instead of leaving it to ToolSearch |
| `connectors.<slug>.max_turns` | `4` | hand-edited; forwarded as the bridge's own `claude -p --max-turns` |
| `connectors.discover_on_start` | `false` | `halo config set connectors.discover_on_start true`; print mode (`-p`) normally never blocks a run on a cold-cache connector discovery -- this opts every run in (the TUI always discovers in the background regardless; `--tools` naming a `connector__<slug>` tool, or a `ToolSearch` call mentioning "connector", also triggers it for just that run) |
| `quit_on_double_ctrl_c` | `true` | `halo config set quit_on_double_ctrl_c false` turns off the second-Ctrl+C quit (only `/exit`/`Ctrl+D`/`Ctrl+Q` leave) |
| `clipboard.crlf` | `false` | hand-edited; `true` makes a copy use `\r\n` line endings instead of `\n` |
| `worktree.remove_on_exit` | `false` | `halo config set worktree.remove_on_exit true`; a `-w/--worktree` session removes its OWN worktree (fires `WorktreeRemoved`) when it ends instead of leaving it on disk |
| `update.check` | `true` | `halo config set update.check false` turns off `halo update`/`/update`'s own check entirely (never shells out, never touches the network) |
| `update.notify` | `true` | `halo config set update.notify false` turns off just the once-a-day "update available" startup note (the check itself, and `/update`'s own dialog, still work) |
| `update.channel` | unset (derived from the install: `stable` when pinned to a `v*` tag, else `main`) | `halo update --channel stable\|main` |
| `ollama.hosts` | unset (synthesizes one default host from `OLLAMA_HOST`/`127.0.0.1:11434`) | hand-edited, or `halo init`'s Ollama tab; a list of `{name, url, default, keep_alive, max_ctx, num_parallel_hint, api_key_env, kv_cache_type, ssh, offline_ok}` -- `ol:<model>@<hostname>` selects an entry by `name`; a saved key lives in the shared env file under the name `api_key_env` points at (never plaintext here -- an older `api_key` value still works and is migrated to `api_key_env` the next time that entry is saved); `offline_ok: true` marks a host that is not otherwise recognized as local (see `network.offline` below) explicitly local anyway; see `docs/MODELS.md`'s "Ollama" section |
| `ollama.tools_max` | unset (derived from the effective `num_ctx`'s context class -- under 16k: 16, 16k-32k: 32, 32k-64k: 64, 64k+: 128) | `halo config set ollama.tools_max 64`; overrides the `ol:` ProviderProfile's tool-catalog cap outright, still never below however many built-in tools this platform ships -- see `docs/MODELS.md`'s "Ollama" section |
| `ollama.auto_calibrate` | `true` | `halo config set ollama.auto_calibrate false`; opts out of running `halo ollama calibrate`'s own stepping procedure automatically the first time a model is used on a host with no learned cap -- see `docs/MODELS.md`'s "Fit calibration" section |
| `ollama.hosts[].kv_cache_type` | unset (`f16`, the conservative default -- never under-estimates memory) | per-host-entry field in `ollama.hosts` (not its own top-level key); `"q8_0"`/`"q4_0"` when that host's own `OLLAMA_KV_CACHE_TYPE` server flag is set to match -- a HINT Halo cannot read back on its own, see `docs/MODELS.md`'s "KV cache type per host" |
| `ollama.hosts[].ssh` | unset (no ssh GPU read; the fit estimate relies on calibration/`/api/ps` alone) | per-host-entry field, e.g. `"ssh": "user@host"` -- an OPTIONAL read-only GPU probe over ssh for a REMOTE host, never required, never prompted for; see `docs/MODELS.md`'s "Optional ssh GPU read" section |
| `huggingface.endpoints` | unset (no dedicated endpoints configured) | hand-edited; a list of `{name, url, token_env, default}` -- `hf:endpoint/<name>` selects an entry by `name`; each entry's own `url`/token are used as-is, never the router's `HF_TOKEN`/base URL; a saved token lives in the shared env file under the name `token_env` points at (an older `token` value still works and is migrated the next time the entry is saved); see `docs/MODELS.md`'s "Hugging Face" section |
| `huggingface.bill_to` | unset (no header sent) | `halo config set huggingface.bill_to my-org`; a Team/Enterprise org name sent as `X-HF-Bill-To` on every ROUTER (`hf:<org>/<model>`) request only -- never on an `hf:endpoint/<name>` call |
| `huggingface.local_servers` | unset (relies on auto-detection alone) | hand-edited, or `halo init`'s Hugging Face tab; a list of `{name, url, api_key_env, default, offline_ok}` -- `hf:local/<model>@<name>` selects an entry by `name`; `hf:local/<model>` (bare) prefers this list's default entry, else the first AUTO-detected local server; a saved key lives in the shared env file under the name `api_key_env` points at (an older `api_key` value still works and is migrated the next time the entry is saved); `offline_ok: true` marks a server not otherwise recognized as local (see `network.offline` below) explicitly local anyway; see `docs/MODELS.md`'s "Hugging Face" section |
| `huggingface.local_probe_ports` | unset (`8080, 8000, 1234` -- see `docs/MODELS.md`) | hand-edited; a list of ints overriding which ports the `hf:local/*` auto-detect sweep probes (loopback only); `HF_LOCAL_PROBE_PORTS` (env) wins over this when both are set |
| `huggingface.lmstudio_models_dir` | unset (`~/.lmstudio/models`, LM Studio's own documented default) | `halo config set huggingface.lmstudio_models_dir /path/to/models`; only needed when LM Studio's own in-app "Model Storage" setting moved the folder -- see `docs/MODELS.md`'s "LM Studio's own model folder" |
| `huggingface.model_dirs` | unset (nothing scanned) | `/local add <path>`/`/local forget <path>` (persisted immediately), `halo init`'s "Local models" step, or hand-edited; a list of folder paths Halo scans recursively for `.gguf` files and safetensors/MLX model folders -- see `docs/MODELS.md`'s "Finding and using file-backed models" |
| `huggingface.preferred_runtime` | unset (Halo picks the only valid runtime per file format: `llama-server` for `.gguf`, `mlx_lm` for safetensors/MLX on Apple Silicon) | `halo init`'s "Local models" step; `"llama-server"` or `"mlx_lm"` -- a `halo local serve --runtime` flag always wins over this; stored for a future round where the same file could genuinely be served more than one way |
| `openai.dialect_overrides` | unset (the built-in table alone: `gpt-6-astra`/`gpt-6.1-sol` default to the Responses dialect, every other `oai:` id to chat completions) | `halo config set openai.dialect_overrides '{"gpt-5": "responses"}'`; a map of bare `oai:` model id to `"chat"`/`"responses"` -- always wins over the table, in either direction; see `docs/MODELS.md`'s "OpenAI API" section |
| `settings.primary` | `"claude"` | `/settings primary claude\|codex`, `halo config set settings.primary codex`, or the init wizard's "Settings sources" step; which of Claude Code's or Codex's own setting wins the merged `/settings`/doctor view when BOTH are set and halo's own config and a live `cx:` session don't already decide it -- see `docs/MODELS.md`'s "Codex settings and instructions" section |
| `experiential.dialect_overrides` | unset (every `xp:` slug uses chat completions by default; no static required-dialect table) | `halo config set experiential.dialect_overrides '{"some-slug": "responses"}'`; same shape as `openai.dialect_overrides`, always wins over the default either direction; see `docs/MODELS.md`'s "Experiential Labs" section |
| `experiential.tool_search` | `false` | `halo config set experiential.tool_search true`; opts into the gateway's `openrouter:tool_search`/`defer_loading` wire convention for Halo's own already-deferred tools on `xp:` routes -- off by default until a live check confirms the shape |
| `experiential.routing.allow_fallbacks` | unset (the gateway's own default, effectively `true`) | `halo config set experiential.routing.allow_fallbacks false`; sent as `gateway.routing.allow_fallbacks` on every `xp:` request once set |
| `experiential.routing.route_id` | unset | `halo config set experiential.routing.route_id rt_...`; pins every `xp:` request to one specific waterfall rung, from `/xp routes <slug>`'s own output |
| `experiential.retry.max_attempts_per_route` | `1` (always sent -- Halo's own outer retry loop is the outer layer already) | `halo config set experiential.retry.max_attempts_per_route 2` |
| `experiential.retry.max_total_attempts` | unset (the gateway's own default) | `halo config set experiential.retry.max_total_attempts 4` |
| `experiential.retry.backoff` | unset (the gateway's own operator policy -- "omitting it keeps the existing policy" is a real, documented choice) | hand-edited; `{"type": "exponential", "base_delay_ms": ..., "max_delay_ms": ..., "multiplier": ...}` or `{"type": "none"}` |
| `experiential.zdr` | `false` | `halo config set experiential.zdr true`; Halo 2.0.4 round 5 -- adds `"provider": {"zdr": true}` to every `xp:` request body (both the chat/Responses dialect and the Anthropic-shaped dialect for a Claude slug), demanding zero-data-retention routing for each one; never touches a bare `ant:`/Databricks-Claude-passthrough/`cc:` body; see `docs/MODELS.md`'s "Zero data retention" note under "Experiential Labs" |

## Every environment variable

2.0.0 rename: every harness-owned knob's CANONICAL name is now `HALO_*`;
the legacy `BRIDGE_*` name (and, for the handful that briefly carried it,
`ROLO_CLAUDE_*`) each still work exactly as before, forever -- resolved in
that order (`HALO_*` first), with one DEBUG-level log line the first time a
legacy name is what actually supplied the value (`--debug`'s own log file).
A handful of test-only seams (`BRIDGE_STATE_DIR`, `BRIDGE_TEST_*`) are
deliberately NOT part of this -- they keep their bare `BRIDGE_` names for
good, with no `HALO_` twin, since the test suites depend on the exact name.

| `OPENROUTER_MANAGEMENT_KEY` | a SEPARATE, higher-privilege OpenRouter key (never the ordinary one above) for the whole-account balance (`GET /credits`) the status bar's "OR $X left" segment/`/cost`/`/providers` show (H15 part 2 addendum 4) -- optional; without it, that segment falls back to the ordinary key's own `/key` usage/limit figures |
| `HALO_OPENROUTER_BASE_URL` (legacy `BRIDGE_OPENROUTER_BASE_URL`) | override the OpenRouter base URL (default `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1`) |
| `DATABRICKS_HOST`, `DATABRICKS_TOKEN` | Databricks credential (see `docs/DATABRICKS.md` for the full discovery chain) |
| `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`, `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` | Claude Code's own work-box env names -- read as a Databricks credential when the host matches a Databricks domain |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | `ant:` route credential (`api.anthropic.com` directly) |
| `HALO_ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` (legacy `BRIDGE_ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`) | override the `ant:` route's own base URL (default `https://api.anthropic.com`) |
| `ANTHROPIC_MODEL`, `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_OPUS_MODEL`, `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_SONNET_MODEL`, `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_HAIKU_MODEL` | at a Databricks work box, set the default model and what bare `opus`/`sonnet`/`haiku` resolve to |
| `ANTHROPIC_CUSTOM_HEADERS` | one-or-more `Name: value` lines, merged onto every Databricks request |
| `HALO_DBX_BASE_URL`, `HALO_DBX_TOKEN` (legacy `BRIDGE_DBX_BASE_URL`/`BRIDGE_DBX_TOKEN`) | explicit override, wins outright over every other Databricks discovery step |
| `HALO_MODEL`, `HALO_MODEL_SMALL` (legacy `BRIDGE_MODEL`/`BRIDGE_MODEL_SMALL`) | override the resolved default main/small model (also used by `halo proxy`) |
| `HALO_ENV_FILE` (legacy `BRIDGE_ENV_FILE`) | path to the `KEY=value` env file (default `~/.config/halo/env`; the legacy `~/.config/vibes-hacker/env` fallback read was removed in 2.0.5 round 3 -- `halo init`'s one-time copy-forward is the migration) |
| `BRIDGE_STATE_DIR` | this harness's own state directory (default `~/.halo`; a test-only-style seam that keeps its bare `BRIDGE_` name for good -- see the note above) |
| `BRIDGE_TEST_HOME` | test/scratch seam: overrides `home()` everywhere (`~/.claude`, `~/.halo`, ...) -- never set this for real use |
| `HALO_CLAUDE_EXE` (legacy `BRIDGE_CLAUDE_EXE`) | override how the `claude` binary is launched (`cc:` route, `--chrome`) |
| `HALO_DUMP=1` (legacy `BRIDGE_DUMP=1`) | dump raw request/response JSON for debugging (proxy mode) |

| `CLAUDE_CODE_SANDBOXED` | any non-empty value counts as "trusted" for the current directory |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_GIT_BASH_PATH` | override Git Bash's location on Windows |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL` | a settings-independent way to set the sub-agent model fallback |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_AUTO_MEMORY=1` | disables auto-memory entirely |
| `VISUAL`, `EDITOR` | external editor for `Ctrl+E` (prompt draft) and `/improve`'s `e` (edit a candidate) |

| `NO_COLOR` | disables ANSI color in `stats`' rich-rendered tables |
| `RC_TERM_WIDTH` | pin `stats`' table width instead of auto-detecting the terminal |

| `CLAUDE_CODE_AUTO_COMPACT_WINDOW` | override the compaction trigger's context-window figure |
| `CLAUDE_AUTOCOMPACT_PCT_OVERRIDE` | lower (never raise) the 80% compaction trigger percentage, 1-100 |

| `TMUX` | presence gates `doctor`'s tmux-mouse-mode check |
| `OLLAMA_HOST` | seeds the `ol:` default host's URL when `ollama.hosts` has no entries configured yet (Ollama's own documented var; a bare `host:port` is normalized to a full URL) |
| `OLLAMA_API_KEY` | seeds that SAME synthesized default host's `api_key` (Ollama Cloud, `Authorization: Bearer`) -- a configured `ollama.hosts` entry's own `api_key` always wins once one exists |
| `HF_TOKEN` | Hugging Face router credential (`hf:<org>/<model>`) -- the ONLY accepted name; `HUGGING_FACE_HUB_TOKEN`/`HF_API_TOKEN` are NOT read (neither was confirmed as a router-specific alias) |
| `HALO_HF_ROUTER_BASE_URL` (legacy `BRIDGE_HF_ROUTER_BASE_URL`) | override the Hugging Face router base URL (default `https://router.huggingface.co/v1`) -- never consulted for `hf:endpoint/<name>`, which always uses that entry's own configured `url` |
| `HF_HUB_CACHE` | the Hugging Face Hub local cache directory itself (used as-is); `/local`'s hub-cache scan walks this when set, else `$HF_HOME/hub`, else `~/.cache/huggingface/hub` |
| `HF_HOME` | the Hugging Face Hub root directory -- `/local`'s hub-cache scan walks `$HF_HOME/hub` when `HF_HUB_CACHE` is unset |
| `HF_LOCAL_PROBE_PORTS` | comma-separated ints overriding which ports the `hf:local/*` auto-detect sweep probes (default `8080,8000,1234` -- see `docs/MODELS.md`); wins over `huggingface.local_probe_ports` when both are set |

| `HALO_OPENAI_BASE_URL` (legacy `BRIDGE_OPENAI_BASE_URL`) | override the OpenAI API base URL (default `https://api.openai.com/v1`) -- the test seam that stands in for the real API everywhere this round's own fake is used |
| `EXPLABS_API_KEY` | the Experiential Labs INFERENCE credential (`xp:<slug>`, prefix `xpl_`) -- calls models, reads `/api/v1/credits`/`/api/v1/usage`; the ONLY key Halo ever asks for or reads |
| `EXPLABS_PROVISIONING_KEY` | a SEPARATE, higher-privilege Experiential Labs key for key management and the full Spend API -- Halo never asks for or assumes this one; listed here only so a redaction pass still knows its name |
| `HALO_EXPERIENTIAL_BASE_URL` (legacy `BRIDGE_EXPERIENTIAL_BASE_URL`) | override the bare inference base URL (default `https://api.experientiallabs.ai/v1`) |
| `HALO_EXPERIENTIAL_ACCOUNT_BASE_URL` (legacy `BRIDGE_EXPERIENTIAL_ACCOUNT_BASE_URL`) | override the account base URL (default `https://api.experientiallabs.ai/api/v1`) -- credits/usage, separate from the inference root above |

## Providers (`halo init --provider ...`)

1.0.1 hotfix 13: `init` selects a PROVIDER to set up, not a "preset" naming
a bundle of choices; the old `--preset home|work|claude` still works, as a
deprecated alias for `--provider openrouter|databricks|claude` respectively
(one-line notice printed, no behavior change).

| Provider | Default model | Credential asked for |
|---|---|---|
| `openrouter` | `or:deepseek/deepseek-v4.1-flash` | `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` |
| `databricks` | `dbx:databricks-deepseek-v4-1-flash` | `DATABRICKS_HOST` + `DATABRICKS_TOKEN` (host often already known -- see `docs/DATABRICKS.md`) |
| `anthropic` | `ant:sonnet` | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` |
| `claude` | `cc:sonnet` | none -- uses your existing `claude` login as-is |

Ollama, Hugging Face, OpenAI API (key), Codex subscription and
Experiential Labs each get their own tab in `halo init`'s INTERACTIVE
Providers step (Halo 2.0.3 round 5 for Ollama/Hugging Face, round 5i for
OpenAI/Codex, Halo 2.0.4 round 2 for Experiential Labs --
`init_providers.TAB_PROVIDERS`). `halo setup`/`/setup` never reach a
Providers step at all (their own step list is `roles`/`orgs`/`summary`
only -- see `docs/COMMANDS.md`'s `setup` section), so none of these tabs
appear there; only `halo init` itself shows them. None of these is a
`halo init --provider`/`--preset` CLI-flag CHOICE, though, and that's
deliberate: that flag drives the OLDER sequential, non-interactive
picker, which has no sensible single hardcoded default model for any of
them (unlike the four providers in the table above, which always have
one well-known catalog entry) -- the same reason that picker's own
no-TTY/Textual-failure fallback never offers any of these tabs. Configure
`HF_TOKEN`/`huggingface.endpoints`/`huggingface.local_servers`/
`ollama.hosts`/`OPENAI_API_KEY`/`EXPLABS_API_KEY` directly instead on a
non-interactive box, or run `codex login` directly for Codex (see
`docs/MODELS.md`'s "Ollama"/"Hugging Face"/"OpenAI API"/"Codex
subscription"/"Experiential Labs" sections). The
wizard's
own "Local models" step (round 5c, right after the Providers step) is
the SAME kind of interactive-only addition -- `huggingface.model_dirs`/
`huggingface.preferred_runtime` above are its two config keys; `/local
add`/`forget` manage the first one from a non-interactive box instead.

### Default permission mode (1.0.1 hotfix 18)

After the provider(s)/default model are settled, `init` also asks for a
**default permission mode** -- `auto` (recommended, listed first),
`acceptEdits`, `default`, `plan` -- written to `~/.halo/config.json`'s
own flat `permission_mode` key. Precedence for a session's actual starting
mode, highest first:

1. `--dangerously-skip-permissions`
2. `--permission-mode` (this run's own flag)
3. `~/.halo/config.json`'s `permission_mode` (this section)
4. `settings.json`'s `permissions.defaultMode` (user layer, or
   project/local for the manual modes, as before)
5. the hardcoded `default`

`halo doctor` prints the effective mode and which layer decided it.
Never touches `~/.claude/settings.json` -- `halo config set
permission_mode auto` (or any of the four modes) sets the same key directly
without re-running `init`.

As of the H14c fixpass (finding 9), this step (and the default-model pick
just before it) only ever writes a value you actually chose THIS run --
`--yes`/non-interactive and Esc both keep whatever is already in
`config.json` unchanged (writing nothing at all for `permission_mode` on a
fresh box, so layer 4 above still applies) instead of forcing `auto`/an
arbitrary other-provider's model over it.

### `network.offline` (Halo 2.0.3 round 5e, locality rule tightened in fix
pass C-1)

`~/.halo/config.json`'s `network.offline` -- `true`/`false`, default
`false`. Set directly (`halo config set network.offline true`) or through
`/offline on|off` (persists the same key); `--offline`/`HALO_OFFLINE=1`
override it for one process WITHOUT persisting anything (checked first,
ahead of this key). While on, the one HTTP choke point
(`halo_harness.providers.http`'s `open_upstream`/`urlopen_tls`) refuses any
connection whose host is not loopback (`127.0.0.1`/`localhost`/`::1`) or
ACTUALLY local by one of three tests:

- a private, loopback, link-local or IPv6 ULA IP literal (RFC1918,
  169.254.0.0/16/fe80::/10, fc00::/7, ...) -- never a hostname that merely
  *resolves* to one; computing this allow-list never itself makes a DNS
  query,
- a bare single-label name (`gpubox`, no dot) or an `.local` mDNS name,
- an `ollama.hosts`/`huggingface.local_servers` entry the user marked
  `offline_ok: true` explicitly.

Checked against every `ollama.hosts[].url` entry, every `huggingface.
local_servers[].url` entry, and every entry in the managed local-server
registry (`halo local serve`'s own `~/.halo/run/local-servers.json` --
always loopback by construction). A hostname that is merely *configured*
is no longer enough by itself: `ollama.com` (saved as an `ollama.hosts`
entry keyed by `api_key`, or reached via an ambient `OLLAMA_HOST=https://
ollama.com` with no config at all) and any other public hostname a user
pastes into either list are refused exactly like any other cloud host.
A loopback or allow-listed host is also never sent through
`HTTPS_PROXY`/`HTTP_PROXY`, and a redirect response is re-checked against
the same gate before it is ever followed.

Covers update checks (including the update command's own `git ls-remote`
fast path, never only its API fallback), catalog refreshes, the Hugging
Face router, OpenRouter, Databricks, Anthropic, the WebFetch/WebSearch
tools, every `cc:`/`cx:` turn and their one-shot small/judge/title calls
(refused outright -- there is no local fallback for a cloud subscription
route), `halo models --cx --refresh`'s codex pings, `--plugin-url`'s `git
clone`, and `hf:mlx`'s first-use model download. `halo update`'s apply
step (the actual reinstall, not just `--check`) returns an error result
instead of running `git pull`/`uv tool install`/`pip install --upgrade`.
The claude.ai connectors bridge's own background/cold-start discovery is
skipped (one DEBUG line) rather than refused, since its real network call
happens inside a spawned `claude` subprocess, outside this process's own
choke point -- an explicit `halo mcp list --refresh`/`/mcp` reconnect still
runs that subprocess regardless (same as running `claude mcp list`
directly in an offline shell would). A refusal is always one plain
sentence: `offline mode: not connecting to <host>` -- never retried, never
treated as a reason to try a `--fallback-model` entry. See
[COMMANDS.md](COMMANDS.md)'s `--offline` and
[SLASH-COMMANDS.md](SLASH-COMMANDS.md)'s `/offline`.

### `routing.escalation` (Halo 2.0.3 round 5e)

`~/.halo/config.json`'s `routing.escalation` -- hybrid escalation as an
explicit policy, local-first:

```json
{
  "routing": {
    "escalation": {
      "to": "or:anthropic/claude-haiku-4.5",
      "when": ["low_confidence", "tool_failures", "context_overflow"],
      "ask": true
    }
  }
}
```

- `to`: the cloud model ref to escalate to.
- `when`: any of `low_confidence` (the `judge` role's own one-word
  confidence check on the local model's final reply -- see `docs/
  ROLES.md`), `tool_failures` (two or more `is_error` tool results in the
  current turn), `context_overflow` (the existing compaction-overflow path
  fired this turn).
- `ask`: `true` (default) asks -- a plain notification naming the trigger
  and target, stays on the local model; `false` switches automatically for
  the rest of the turn (`tool_failures`/`context_overflow`) or from the
  next model call on (`low_confidence`, since the turn that triggered it
  is already over), with a transcript note ("escalated to \<ref\>:
  \<trigger\>").

Only ever evaluated on a local-model session (`ol:`/`hf:local`/`hf:mlx`) --
never on a cloud-model session, and never onto a target `network.offline`/
`--offline` would itself refuse (fix pass C-2): the session stays local,
with one plain notice naming the trigger, when the two conflict -- never a
silent switch onto a model every later request would then also be refused
for. A role-table entry's own `"escalation": false` turns it off for every
sub-agent built under that role (`halo roles`/`docs/ROLES.md`), regardless
of this top-level setting. An auto-switch (`ask: false`) leaves a real
trace, not just a 5-second toast: a permanent transcript line, an
immediate status-bar model update, and -- in print mode -- an
`escalations` entry on the `-p --output-format json` result object.
`/escalation` shows the active policy and this session's last few
decisions. See [MODELS.md](MODELS.md)'s "Hybrid escalation" section.

### Saved versus cloud (Halo 2.0.3 round 5e)

A local-model session (`ol:`/`hf:local`/`hf:mlx`) tracks what the same
input/output/cache tokens would have cost on a reference cloud price (the
configured `routing.escalation.to`, or, with no escalation policy at all,
the vendored catalog's median priced model) and reports the running total
as `saved_usd`. Fix pass C-2: it only ever accrues while the session is
CURRENTLY running on a local model -- after an escalation, a `/model`
switch, or a `--fallback-model` swap onto a cloud ref it stops growing
immediately, and resumes with no re-pinning needed the moment the session
is back on a local one (the reference price itself, once resolved, stays
pinned for the session's life either way). `/cost` shows the full
breakdown; the status bar appends "· saved $x" to the cost segment. See
[MODELS.md](MODELS.md)'s "Saved versus cloud" section.

## What is never written

- `~/.claude.json`, `~/.claude/settings.json` -- **never** touched by
  `init`/`doctor`/the agent loop; the ONE deliberate exception is
  `halo mcp add`/`add-json`/`remove` writing `~/.claude.json`'s
  `mcpServers` keys, precisely mirroring what `claude mcp add`/`remove`
  itself writes.
- `~/.claude/.credentials.json` -- **never opened at all**, not even to
  check it exists. The `cc:`/`ant:` subscription check reads only
  `claude auth status`'s own JSON output.
- A provider API key or Databricks token is never written into a session
  log, a cache file, or a `doctor`/`--config`/`stats` line -- `redact()`
  keeps the first four characters and elides the rest; `halo export
  --sanitize`/`/export --sanitize` additionally scrub anything that slipped
  into a transcript via a tool's own output (a Bash `env` dump, a Read of a
  settings file).
- An `ollama.hosts`/`huggingface.endpoints`/`huggingface.local_servers` key
  saved through `halo init`'s tabs is never written into `config.json` as
  plaintext either (fix pass C-1) -- it goes into the same shared env file
  `DATABRICKS_TOKEN`/`HF_TOKEN` already use, under a generated name
  (`HALO_SECRET_<KIND>_<NAME>`), and `config.json` keeps only that name
  (`api_key_env`/`token_env`). `~/.halo/config.json` is written 0600 on
  POSIX whenever the platform supports it, and `halo config list`/`config
  get` mask any secret-shaped value (an older plaintext `api_key`/`token`
  entry included) rather than printing it verbatim. A malformed config
  entry is ever only logged by its own `name`, never `%r` of the whole
  entry.
