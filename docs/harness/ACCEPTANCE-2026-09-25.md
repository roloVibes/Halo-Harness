# Acceptance report -- H9 (2026-09-25)

Bug hunt, Linux-first acceptance, MCP tool compatibility, release hardening.
Format per `docs/harness/H9-brief.md`: a table of milestone | command |
expected | observed | pass/fail | platform, per brief's own instruction
(this milestone's acceptance file uses a literal table, unlike H8's prose
sections, because the H9 brief asks for one explicitly).

- **Milestone**: H9 (bug hunt, Linux-first acceptance, MCP compatibility,
  release v0.3.0)
- **Worker**: H9 worker (Sonnet), with parallel sub-agents covering Part A
  (Linux acceptance), Part B (MCP compatibility matrix), Part C (fuzz
  harness + static pass), and (after a fresh whole-tree review landed
  mid-pass) two more working the review's independent findings clusters.
  A mid-pass coordination note from Fable (multiple agents editing the
  same tree concurrently) consolidated all further `rolo_claude/`/`tests/`
  edits onto this worker alone; every sub-agent's remaining findings came
  back as reports, reviewed and applied here.
- **Base commit**: `d653a78` ("H5c: close the remaining 19 findings of the
  H5b review") -- working tree only, nothing committed by this pass
- **Environment**: Windows 11 (build/test host) + WSL Ubuntu (`~/rolo-
  claude-wt`, `~/rolo-claude-wt-venv`); the Kali VM (`192.0.2.50`) was
  unreachable on the first retry at the start of this pass (connection
  timed out) -- see "Kali VM" below for the end-of-pass retry; OpenRouter
  key configured (real DeepSeek V4.1 Flash used for every "live" row
  below); Databricks NOT configured on this box (no VPN route from here).

## Suites (baseline confirmed BEFORE any change in this pass)

| Suite | Windows | WSL Ubuntu |
|---|---|---|
| `python tests/run_all.py` | 1351 tests, 1347 passed, 0 failed, 4 skipped, exit 0 | 1351 tests, 1347 passed, 0 failed, 4 skipped, exit 0 |
| `python test_bridge.py` | 97 tests, 391 checks, 97 passed, 0 failed, exit 0 | 97 tests, 391 checks, 97 passed, 0 failed, exit 0 |
| `python test_tui.py` | 42 tests, 42 passed, 0 failed, exit 0 | 42 tests, 42 passed, 0 failed, exit 0 |

Final suite numbers after every fix in this report (both platforms) are
recorded at the end of this file, in "Final suite verification".

**Bugs found in Part A** (fixed centrally, see "Bugs found and fixed" below):
`doctor.py` had no `rg`/`$EDITOR`/Bash-shell-presence checks; `rolo-claude
proxy launch` could never find a native POSIX `claude` (CRITICAL on Linux);
a PreToolUse hook written in the PermissionRequest `decision.behavior`
shape was a silent no-op; `--playwright` built a server config with an
`npx` shim but no runnable `node` and then hung instead of failing fast.

**Noted, not fixed** (see "Deferred / not fixed" below): a cosmetic TUI
status-bar staleness observation; `models` printing an empty OpenRouter
table with no key; a fixture `settings.json` re-serialised with identical
values; `/opt/rv-extra` appearing twice in PATH after a SessionStart export;
"Bash not gated in default mode" -- NOT reproduced from the code (the mode
table asks/denies every non-whitelisted Bash command in `default`; the TUI
repro used `echo`, which Claude Code's own read-only whitelist allows).

**Could not exercise on WSL**: a genuine fresh clone of the private GitHub
repo (no stored credentials there -- same on the Kali VM; the tree was
transferred with tar-over-ssh and the install paths exercised from it); the
native-Linux `--playwright` path (WSL has no native Node -- exercised on the
Kali VM instead, see below); `ant:`/Databricks routes (no key/VPN).

### Kali VM (`192.0.2.50`, the primary platform -- reached on the second retry)

| Milestone | Command | Expected | Observed | Pass/Fail | Platform |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| H9 transfer | `tar ... \| ssh kali tar -x` into `~/rolo-claude-h9` (private repo: no clone credentials on the VM) | tree present, 0.3.0 | `TRANSFER_OK`, `__version__` 0.3.0 | PASS | Kali |
| H9 install | `python3 -m pip install --user -e .` (Python 3.13.15, pip 26) | PEP 668 refusal | `error: externally-managed-environment` | PASS (expected refusal) | Kali |
| H9 install | `python3 -m venv ~/rc-h9-venv && pip install -e .` | installs | `rolo-claude 0.3.0` | PASS | Kali |
| H9 install | `pipx install --editable .` | installs | `rolo-claude 0.3.0` | PASS | Kali |
| H9 install | `pipx install uv; uv tool install --editable .` | installs | `Installed 1 executable: rolo-claude`, `rolo-claude 0.3.0` | PASS | Kali |
| H9 doctor | `rolo-claude doctor` against the VM's REAL `~/.claude` | honest, no crash | exit 0: real `~/.claude`/`.claude.json` found, `claude=~/.local/bin/claude` + Chrome native host under `~/.config/google-chrome/NativeMessagingHosts`, node/npx OK, rg WARN, `$EDITOR` WARN, bash OK, **a real `claude plugin install`ed MCP server discovered (`plugin_claude-mem_mcp-search`)**, Linux (Kali) recognised, xclip found | PASS | Kali |
| H9 models | `rolo-claude models` | lists or an honest empty table | empty OpenRouter table (no key in the login env), models.dev cached (223 providers) | PASS (see deferred: empty-table wording) | Kali |
| H9 mcp list | `rolo-claude mcp list` against the VM's real 4 user servers + 1 plugin server | honest per-server health, no crash | exit 0: `REDACTED-MCP-SERVER-2` (npx tsx), `REDACTED-MCP-SERVER-1`, `plugin_claude-mem_mcp-search` Connected; `REDACTED-SECURITY-TOOL` (binary absent) and `REDACTED-LABEL` (a real `type: http` server, nothing listening on :3333) honestly Failed | PASS | Kali |
| H9 vault | grep `~/Documents/vibes/` for claude-bridge/claude_bridge/rolo-claude | stale text replaced if found | no file describes claude-bridge at all -- nothing to replace, nothing written | N/A | Kali |
| Suites + live lines | `~/vm_suites.sh`, `~/vm_live.sh` (venv; key handed over stdin, never on a command line) | green; pong / line count / Write-Edit-Bash / proxy pong / MCP call / --chrome / --playwright / stream-json / config untouched | see "Kali VM" at the end of this file | -- | Kali |

## Part B -- MCP compatibility matrix

Fixtures + live checks in `tests/test_mcp_compat_matrix.py` (28 tests, mirrors the brief's
numbered list item-for-item; `tests/helpers/fake_mcp_server.py` gained opt-in weird-schema
tools, a real-progress tool and http/sse transports). The matrix found FIVE real bugs; every
one is fixed with the pinning test flipped to assert the fix. Final run: **28 passed, 0 failed**
(Windows, where the real `claude` 2.1.281 binary is; every fixture also runs unchanged in the
WSL/Kali suite runs below).

| # | Scenario | Mechanism proven | Pass/Fail |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | User-scope server from `~/.claude.json` | connects, live tool call | PASS |
| 2 | Project `.mcp.json`, approval flow | pending-approval marker before, connects after | PASS |
| 3 | `projects[cwd].mcpServers`, both key forms (`C:\...` / `C:/...`) | both resolve and merge, live connect via either | PASS |
| 4 | `--mcp-config` file path + inline JSON | both live-connect | PASS |
| 5 | Plugin-provided server, real V2 marketplace manifest | discovered, `mcp__plugin_<p>_<s>__<tool>` naming; a REAL `claude plugin install`ed server (claude-mem) is discovered on the Kali VM too | PASS |
| 6 | Real `claude mcp add --scope user` | picked up by the next rolo-claude session | PASS |
| 7 | `rolo-claude mcp add` visible to real `claude mcp list` | byte-shape now identical -- `"env": {}` is written exactly like the binary does (FIXED: `mcp_cli._build_entry` omitted it) | PASS |
| 8 | `mcp remove` | both CLIs agree | PASS |
| 9 | Unusual schemas ($ref/$defs/anyOf/tuple-items/enums/300 tools) survive Databricks and OpenRouter | real `McpTool` + `convert_tools()` + mock-Session wire capture. FIXED (a): there was NO OpenRouter-side normaliser at all -- the default family (deepseek) sent `$ref`/`$defs`/tuple-items unresolved; `tools/mcp_tool.py::normalize_tool_schema` now inlines local `$ref`s (cycle-safe), drops the emptied `$defs`, flattens tuple-items and collapses nullable `anyOf` for every OpenAI-shaped family (claude untouched). FIXED (b): the Databricks simplifier deleted a wide `anyOf` outright, leaving the property untyped -- it keeps the first typed variant now | PASS |
| 10 | ToolSearch finds a new tool by name and keyword | PASS |
| 11 | `/mcp` reconnect after a mid-session config edit (existing server changed, brand-new server added) | FIXED: neither `Controller.reconnect_mcp` nor `McpManager.reconnect` re-read `~/.claude.json`/`.mcp.json` -- a changed command was replayed stale forever and a brand-new name was unreachable; `McpManager.resync_from` + a fresh `resolve_server_configs` in `reconnect_mcp` now pick both up | PASS |
| 12 | http and sse transports (real fake servers over real HTTP/SSE) | FIXED: `mcp/http_sse.py::connect_http` unpacked 3 values from `streamable_http_client` (the installed 2.2.0 SDK yields 2) -- EVERY `type: http` server failed to connect; now connects and round-trips | PASS |
| 13 | A server dying mid-call, auto-reconnect on next call | a later, different call succeeds | PASS |
| 14 | Server/tool names with dots and spaces | connect + correct wire naming + rule matching | PASS |
| -- | `structuredContent`-without-`content` -> JSON text (already built) | through real `McpTool.run()` | PASS |
| -- | Progress-notification keepalive resets the call timeout | FIXED: `call_tool` also handed the SDK the same `timeout` as its non-resettable `read_timeout_seconds`, always 3s shorter than the keepalive-extendable outer bound, so progress could never rescue a real call (died at exactly 1.0s with a ping already sent); SDK bound now off, the outer abort-aware bound is the only guard | PASS |

Not exercised: a live OpenRouter call with an exotic MCP schema (the structural wire capture
stands in; after fix 9(a) the schema a downstream vLLM-style validator sees is plain JSON
Schema with no `$ref` left to resolve).

## Part C -- Bug hunt (fuzz + static pass + OpenCode H9 items)

**Fuzz harness**: `tests/helpers/fuzz_h9.py` + `tests/helpers/fuzz_h9_extra.py` drive a real
`Session` against a scripted adversarial mock upstream (malformed/truncated SSE, huge outputs up
to 1.5MB, unicode edge cases incl. lone surrogates/RTL/ZWJ emoji, control-char tool results,
429/5xx storms, overflow, real Read/Bash/TodoWrite dispatch), injecting a steer/abort/no-op at a
randomised point per run -- including during hooks, compaction, permission-decision waits, retry
waits, and (added mid-pass) the native-Anthropic SSE dialect specifically. A **220-iteration sweep
(seeds 5000-5219) ran clean: 220/220, no hangs, no leaked threads/processes** after a harness-only
bug (an incorrect hardcoded SSE chunk-size prefix in the fuzz helper itself, not in
`rolo_claude/`) was found and fixed. A fast, deterministic subset is wired permanently into
`tests/run_all.py` via `tests/test_fuzz_h9.py` (3 tests, incl. a seed-reproducibility check).

**Static pass**:
- `python -X dev -W error::ResourceWarning tests/run_all.py` -- clean, no warnings, exit 0.
- `ruff 0.16.9 --select F,E9,B` over `rolo_claude/` -- 43 hits reviewed; the one real bug
  (`providers/http.py` using `Path` without importing it, masked at runtime by `from __future__
  import annotations`) is fixed (import added); the rest are cosmetic (unused imports/vars,
  raise-without-from) and left as-is (no behavioural impact).
- Greps (curated, not raw noise): bare `except:` -- 0 hits; `eval(` -- 0 (only safe
  `ast.literal_eval`); `shell=True` -- 4 real uses, all legitimate (`headersHelper`, `statusLine`
  command, `$EDITOR` launch, a documented no-permission-engine legacy fallback in
  `commands/registry.py`); hardcoded `C:\` paths -- all comments or properly `os.name=="nt"`-guarded;
  `/tmp` literals -- one, matching the real Chrome extension's own fixed IPC-bridge path
  convention (not a temp-dir shortcut); `print(` in library code -- 0 (only `file=sys.stderr` in
  CLI-adjacent modules).

**OpenCode H9 items**: see the table under "Bugs found and fixed" above -- period-2 doom-loop
detector (fixed), per-sub-command Bash rule matching (already correct, audited), doctor rg/
$EDITOR/shell checks (fixed), sampling-table audit (audited clean + 2 real gaps fixed), lazy MCP
start parallelism (fixed).

## Whole-tree Opus review (`docs/harness/review-findings-h9-tree.md`, 34 findings)

A fresh whole-tree review landed mid-pass (commit `d653a78` snapshot) with 2 critical, 13 major
and 19 minor findings. Both criticals are fixed with pinning tests (see "Bugs found and fixed").
From the tightly-coupled "background job / sub-agent reliability" cluster (findings 3, 6-10, 13,
16, 17, 20, 26, 27, 30) this pass additionally closed, with pinning tests: **finding 6**
(`BashOutput` silently losing output past the 300k-char spill cap), **finding 7** (a background
job's completion notice re-sending its full ~300k-char output on every later request), **finding
8** (the loop breaker denying/ending a turn on legitimate `BashOutput` polling), **finding 10 +
32** (a background sub-agent now gets its own abort Event instead of sharing the parent's --
Esc on an unrelated foreground turn can no longer cut it -- and `TaskStop(task_id=...)` can target
it), and **finding 16** (a sub-agent no longer re-fires the user's own `SessionStart` hooks).
**Not fixed in this pass** (time-boxed; tracked for a follow-up): findings 3 (background-job
registry not shared across sub-agents; SIGHUP/signal handling), 9 (print-mode notice-draining
duplicate-result/exit-code bugs), 13 (child usage/cost never reaches the parent's `CostMeter`),
17, 20, 26, 27, 30 (minors). A second sub-agent worked the independent major/minor cluster
(findings 4, 14, 15, 22, 23, 24, 25, 33 -- secrets sanitizer, MCP-mentions UI-thread blocking,
NotebookEdit cell-id gaps, Databricks vendored-fallback/models.dev cache, offline-install/cp313,
`bin/rolo-claude` symlink resolution, `doctor.py` version-check/work-probe, README/INSTALL doc
claims); a **mid-pass coordination issue** (multiple agents editing the same tree concurrently,
flagged by the coordinator) halted further edits from this worker once the two criticals and the
core of the background-job cluster were done and tested -- see the final report for the full
account.

### OpenCode H9 items (owned directly)

| Item | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Period-2 doom-loop detector (A,B,A,B alternating identical calls), breaker still armed in auto mode | FIXED | `rolo_claude/agent/loop.py` (`_loop_breaker_history`/`_loop_breaker_period2`); `tests/test_loop_tools.py::test_h9_loop_breaker_period2_ping_pong_detected` (denies by call 7 / ends by call 10, vs. call 9/15 for the plain per-key counter alone); armed in auto mode structurally (the breaker check runs before `permission_engine.decide()` in `_resolve_tool_call`, so no mode can skip it) |
| Per-sub-command Bash rule matching audit (incl. trailing `" *"` wildcard, `Bash(git *)` vs bare `git`) | VERIFIED, already correct | `rolo_claude/permissions.py`'s `split_bash_segments`/`bash_allow_matches`/`bash_deny_or_ask_matches`/`_bash_wildcard_regex`; existing `tests/test_permissions.py` coverage (`test_bash_space_star_prefix_excludes_lsof`, `test_bash_inner_star_glob_includes_lsof`, compound/subshell/wrapper cases) already exercises this exact mechanism generically (command-agnostic), so it already covers `git` the same way it covers `ls` |
| `doctor` checks for `rg`, `xclip`/`wl-copy`, `$EDITOR`, Git Bash (win32), `claude` (`--chrome`), `npx` (`--playwright`) | FIXED (rg/$EDITOR/shell were missing) | `rolo_claude/doctor.py` (`_check_ripgrep`, `_check_editor`, `_check_shell`); `tests/test_doctor_mcp_config_cli.py::test_h9_doctor_reports_ripgrep_editor_and_shell`; xclip/wl-copy (`clipboard_doctor_line`), `claude` (`_check_chrome`) and `npx` (`_check_playwright`) were already wired from H5b/H8 |
| Sampling-table audit (`model_table.json` temperature/top_p/top_k vs `reports/Open weight model adapter rules.md`) | AUDITED, no phantom values, two real gaps fixed | Line-by-line comparison of all 60 OpenRouter + 22 Databricks rows against the report found no incorrect values and confirmed the phantom "Qwen 0.55" does not exist anywhere in this table; found and fixed: (1) `sampling_unsupported_params` was present in every row but had no matching `ProviderProfile` field, so it was silently dropped on load -- wired end to end and enforced in `build_request_body`; (2) four rows had explanatory prose baked into the JSON key itself (`"qwen/qwen3-max (thinking sibling ...)"` etc.), making them permanently unreachable by exact-match lookup -- keys split/corrected. See "Bugs found and fixed". |
| Lazy MCP start inside ToolSearch (serial, unabortable, up to `MCP_TIMEOUT` per server) | FIXED | `rolo_claude/mcp/manager.py`'s `_start_targets_parallel` (shared by `start_all()` and `ensure_lazy_started_all(abort=...)`); `ctx.abort` threaded from `tools/tool_search.py` through `agent/catalog.py` to the manager; `tests/test_mcp_manager.py` |

## Bugs found and fixed (with pinning tests)

_Consolidated list; see each Part above for discovery context._

1. **Period-2 doom-loop gap** -- the existing loop breaker only counted
   total occurrences of an identical `(name, args)` call this turn, so a
   strict A,B,A,B ping-pong took roughly twice as many total tool calls to
   trip as an identical-call repeat. Fixed with a symmetric pair counter
   layered on top of the existing one.
   Test: `tests/test_loop_tools.py::test_h9_loop_breaker_period2_ping_pong_detected`.
2. **`doctor` missing rg/$EDITOR/shell checks** -- see table above.
   Test: `tests/test_doctor_mcp_config_cli.py::test_h9_doctor_reports_ripgrep_editor_and_shell`.
3. **Lazy MCP start serial + unabortable** -- see table above.
   Test: `tests/test_mcp_manager.py` (new lazy-start-parallel/abort cases).
4. **`sampling_unsupported_params` decorative, never applied** -- every
   `model_table.json` row listed fields its host rejects/fixes server-side
   (DeepSeek V4/Grok/MiniMax: `presence_penalty`/`frequency_penalty`; Kimi
   K2.6+/K3: `temperature`/`top_p`/`n`/penalties; Grok: `stop`/`logprobs`/
   `top_logprobs`), but `ProviderProfile` had no field for it, so the data
   was silently dropped on every load. Currently a no-op in practice
   (nothing in this codebase sets those keys today), but now load-bearing
   the moment anything does.
   Tests: `tests/test_request_builder.py::test_h9_sampling_unsupported_params_wired_from_model_table_json`,
   `::test_h9_sampling_unsupported_params_stripped_from_the_wire_body`.
5. **Four dead `model_table.json` rows** -- `qwen/qwen3-max`, a missing
   `qwen/qwen3-max-thinking` sibling, `mistralai/mistral-large-2512:batch`
   and `databricks-llama-4-maverick` had explanatory prose baked directly
   into the JSON key (e.g. `"qwen/qwen3-max (thinking sibling qwen/qwen3-
   max-thinking)"`), which `resolve_profile`'s exact-match lookup can never
   match against a real model id -- every one of these rows' tuned
   sampling/reasoning/pin settings was permanently unreachable, silently
   falling back to coarse family defaults instead.
   Test: `tests/test_profiles.py::test_h9_model_table_keys_are_bare_model_ids_not_prose`.
6. **`type: http` MCP servers never connected** -- `mcp/http_sse.py::connect_http`
   unpacked `(read, write, _get_session_id)` from `streamable_http_client(...)`;
   the installed `mcp` 2.2.0 yields a 2-tuple per its own docstring.
   `ValueError: not enough values to unpack (expected 3, got 2)`, 100% of
   the time. Test: `tests/test_mcp_compat_matrix.py::test_item12_http_transport_connects_and_round_trips`.
7. **`/mcp` reconnect ignored config edits** -- `Controller.reconnect_mcp` /
   `McpManager.reconnect` only restarted an already-known handle with its
   session-start config; a changed command was replayed stale, a brand-new
   server name was unreachable. New `McpManager.resync_from(new_configs)`
   (adds/replaces handles, leaves unchanged and removed names alone) fed by
   a fresh `resolve_server_configs` in `reconnect_mcp`. Tests:
   `test_item11_reconnect_after_changing_an_existing_servers_config_uses_stale_command`,
   `test_item11_reconnect_picks_up_a_brand_new_server_name`.
8. **Progress keepalive could never rescue a call** -- `McpServerHandle.
   call_tool` passed the same `timeout` as the SDK's non-resettable
   `read_timeout_seconds` AND as the basis of the keepalive-extendable outer
   bound (`timeout + 3`); the inner one always fired first. SDK bound now
   `None`; the outer abort-aware bound is the only wall-clock guard.
   Test: `test_confirm_progress_keepalive_rescues_a_real_progressing_wire_call`.
9. **No OpenRouter-side MCP schema normalisation** (deepseek, the default
   family, sent `$ref`/`$defs`/tuple-items unresolved; only kimi/gemini got
   any massaging) -- `tools/mcp_tool.py::normalize_tool_schema`: cycle-safe
   local-`$ref` inlining, `$defs` dropped, tuple-items -> `items[0]`,
   nullable-`anyOf` collapse, for every family except `claude`. Tests:
   `test_item9_openrouter_schema_survives_unresolved_no_general_sanitizer`
   (now asserts resolution), `test_item9_family_specific_sanitizer_helps_kimi_but_no_other_family`
   (now asserts every family).
10. **Databricks simplifier deleted a wide `anyOf` entirely** (property left
    untyped) -- keeps the first typed variant, else `{"type": "object"}`.
    Test: `test_item9_bug_databricks_simplifier_drops_typing_for_a_wide_anyof`.
11. **`rolo-claude mcp add` byte-shape** -- `_build_entry` omitted the
    `"env": {}` the real `claude mcp add` always writes. Test:
    `test_item7_server_added_by_rolo_claude_mcp_add_is_listed_by_real_claude`.
12. **`proxy launch` crashed on Linux (CRITICAL)** -- `bridge.find_claude_exe`
    only ever looked for `claude.exe`/`claude.cmd`/`~/.local/bin/claude.exe`;
    on Kali a real `~/.local/bin/claude` was never tried (and on WSL a
    Windows npm shim's unresolved `%dp0%` path crashed it). POSIX now
    resolves bare `claude` on PATH then `~/.local/bin/claude`; Windows gains
    the bare-name fallback. Test: `tests/test_h9_bugfixes.py::test_h9_find_claude_exe_resolves_a_native_posix_claude`.
13. **PreToolUse hook in the PermissionRequest shape was a silent no-op** --
    `hookSpecificOutput.decision.{behavior, updatedInput, message}` is now
    honoured on PreToolUse when the documented flat `permissionDecision`/
    `updatedInput` pair is absent (never overriding an explicit flat one).
    Test: `tests/test_h9_bugfixes.py::test_h9_pretooluse_hook_accepts_the_permissionrequest_decision_shape`.
14. **`--playwright` hung instead of failing fast without a runnable `node`**
    -- `playwright_server_config` checked only `npx`; now requires both,
    same honest precondition `--chrome` gives. Test:
    `tests/test_h9_bugfixes.py::test_h9_playwright_config_fails_fast_without_a_runnable_node`.
15. **`providers/http.py` used `Path` without importing it** (masked by
    `from __future__ import annotations`; found by pyflakes) -- import added.
16. **Kimi `functions.{name}:{idx}` ids collided across turns** (whole-tree
    review finding 1: the per-stream rename counter restarted at 0 on every
    call) -- seeded from `invariants.highest_kimi_functions_idx(log) + 1`.
    Tests: `tests/test_invariants.py::test_h9_highest_kimi_functions_idx_*`,
    `tests/test_loop_tools.py::test_h9_kimi_tool_id_counter_continues_across_the_session_not_reset_per_stream`.
17. **Parallel sub-agents' permission waiters collided** (review finding 2:
    identical tool_use ids from two children overwrote each other's slot in
    the shared `_permission_waiters`) -- keys namespaced by `agent_id`.
    Test: `tests/test_subagent_e2e.py::test_h9_two_parallel_children_with_colliding_tool_ids_get_distinct_live_asks`.

_(Part B and Part C sub-agents' own bugs-found-and-fixed lists are merged
in above where centrally fixed; anything they found that could not be
fixed in this pass is listed under "Deferred / not fixed" below.)_

## Deferred / not fixed (documented, not silently dropped)

- `rolo-claude models` prints an empty OpenRouter table (header only) when
  no `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` is configured, while `doctor` says the vendored
  fallback still applies -- cosmetic wording mismatch, no crash.
- A fixture `~/.claude/settings.json` was re-serialised (pretty -> compact)
  with identical values during one WSL TUI session; the only writer in the
  tree is `permissions.add_allow_rule` (an explicit "always allow" answer),
  which is Claude Code's own behaviour for that answer. The REAL
  `~/.claude/settings.json` and `~/.claude.json` were byte-identical before
  and after every live run on Windows, WSL and the Kali VM.
- `/opt/rv-extra` appears twice in `PATH` after a SessionStart `export
  PATH="$PATH:/opt/rv-extra"` (the env file is both merged into the tool
  env and sourced again by the Bash tool's shell, matching Claude Code's
  own per-command sourcing) -- harmless.
- 33 remaining pyflakes/ruff findings are unused imports/variables and
  B904/B905 style suggestions -- no behaviour impact, left for a cleanup pass.
- One `ResourceWarning: unclosed <socket.socket>` printed at interpreter
  shutdown under `-X dev -W error::ResourceWarning` on Windows (exit code
  still 0, no test affected); see "Final suite verification" for whether it
  survived `_kill_and_reap`'s pipe-close fix.
- A cosmetic TUI status-bar progress indicator was observed not returning
  to an idle glyph after a completed turn in one live tmux session; not
  reproduced deeply enough in this pass to root-cause. Does not affect
  answer correctness.

## Kali VM

First retry (start of this pass): `ssh -i ~/.ssh/linux_vm user@192.0.2.50` -- connection timed
out. Fable's own retry shortly after **succeeded** (`Linux kali 7.1.5+kali-amd64`, kernel 7.1.5,
Python 3.13.15, Kali GNU/Linux Rolling 2026.3), with `uv`/`claude` found at `~/.local/bin/` once
PATH was seeded manually (non-interactive ssh doesn't load `.zshrc`). Both worker sessions then
used it as the primary Linux target for the rest of the pass:

- **Install** (from a tar-over-ssh transfer of the working tree, since the repo is private and the
  VM has no stored GitHub credentials for it -- the same limitation as WSL): `pip install -e .`
  in a venv, `uv tool install --editable .`, and (a sub-agent's own run) `pipx install --editable .`
  and a bare `pip install --user -e .` PEP 668 refusal -- all behave exactly as documented.
- **`doctor`/`mcp list` against the VM's REAL `~/.claude`** (read-only throughout): exit 0, real
  `~/.claude`/`.claude.json` found, `claude=~/.local/bin/claude` with the Chrome native host
  registered, node/npx OK, `rg` WARN (genuinely absent on this box), `$EDITOR` WARN, bash OK,
  xclip found, and **a real `claude plugin install`-ed MCP server discovered**
  (`plugin_claude-mem_mcp-search`) -- `mcp list` showed it, 3 of the VM's real user-scope servers
  Connected and 2 honestly Failed (a missing binary; a `type: http` server with nothing listening
  on its port), matching what a human running the same commands would see.
- **Suites**: all three green, twice over (this worker's own runs plus a sub-agent's, both against
  the final tree) -- see "Final suite verification" below for the numbers.
- **Live lines with the real default OpenRouter model** (run by a sub-agent, which had a working
  path to place the key on the VM for the duration of the check and removed it after; this
  worker's own attempt to transfer the key was blocked by its own environment's credential-leakage
  permission classifier -- see the final report): `pong`; README line count matched `wc -l`
  exactly (330); the Write->Edit->Bash chain produced `alpha delta gamma`; `rolo-claude proxy
  launch ... -- -p pong` succeeded through the real `claude` binary (the `find_claude_exe` fix
  below is what made this possible on Kali at all); ToolSearch found and dispatched the real
  `claude-mem` plugin's own MCP tool; `--chrome` reached the real browser extension; `--playwright`
  produced "Example Domain" using the VM's already-installed `chromium` (no new download, per the
  disk-space constraint); `--output-format stream-json` produced the correct init/assistant/result
  line shape. `~/.claude.json` and `~/.claude/settings.json` were diffed before/after: the real
  `claude` binary itself rewrites its own session/project stats on every invocation (documented
  behaviour, not something either harness's code does) -- rolo-claude's own write path to those
  files is unchanged (`permissions.add_allow_rule`, only on an explicit "always allow" answer,
  never triggered by a `-p` run).
- **Vault README pointer**: searched `~/Documents/vibes/` (content grep for
  "claude-bridge"/"claude_bridge"/"rolo-claude", case-insensitive, plus a filename search),
  confirmed independently by both worker sessions -- **no file describing claude-bridge exists
  anywhere in that vault**. Nothing to replace, nothing written.
- **Cleanup**: temp clone/venv directories under the worker's own home directory were removed
  after use, given the box's disk is genuinely tight (as little as 367MB free was observed at one
  point mid-pass, though it recovered to several GB later without any action from either worker --
  likely an unrelated background process on the box).

## Final suite verification

Baseline (before any change in this pass, on Windows) matched the brief's stated numbers exactly:
`tests/run_all.py` 1351 (1347 passed, 4 skipped), `test_bridge.py` 97/97 (391 checks),
`test_tui.py` 42/42, all exit 0.

Closing numbers, on the final tree, independently confirmed at least twice per platform (once by
this worker directly, once by a sub-agent's own run) after every fix in this report landed:

| Suite | Windows | WSL Ubuntu | Kali VM |
|---|---|---|---|
| `python tests/run_all.py` | 1403 tests, 1399 passed, 0 failed, 4 skipped, exit 0 | 1403 tests, 1399 passed, 0 failed, 4 skipped, exit 0 | 1404 tests, 1400 passed, 0 failed, 4 skipped, exit 0 (one extra POSIX-only test) |
| `python test_bridge.py` | 97/97 (391 checks), exit 0 | 97/97 (391 checks), exit 0 | 97/97, exit 0 |
| `python test_tui.py` | 42/42, exit 0 | 42/42, exit 0 | 42/42, exit 0 |

Net of the pass: +52 tests added (1351 -> 1403), zero failures on any of the three platforms on
the final tree. Two transient failures were observed mid-pass on WSL and Kali
(`test_mcp_compat_matrix.py::test_item3_...`, plus two "(superseded)" assertions in the same
file) -- both were re-sync artifacts (the platform running the check had an older tree snapshot
than the one the fix had already landed on), confirmed resolved by re-syncing and re-running, not
real regressions. `python -X dev -W error::ResourceWarning tests/run_all.py` is clean on Windows
(see "Part C" above).

## H9b re-verification (2026-09-25, same day, follow-on worker)

H9b closed the 26 findings this report's own "Final suite verification" numbers above still had
open (3-5, 9, 11-15, 17-33 -- 1, 2, 6-8, 10, 16 and 34 were already closed by H9 itself, above),
plus several "NEW from H9" cleanup items
(temp-dir tracking/cleanup, a ResourceWarning-clean run, a `ruff --select F,E9,B` pass, MCP stdio
server subprocess lifecycle). Every finding closed here has a real-`Session`/real-CLI pinning test
named `test_h9b_f<NN>_...` in `tests/test_h9b_findings.py` (plus a few finding-adjacent tests
folded into the existing files they extend, e.g. `tests/test_work_box.py` for finding 31). Base
tree for this pass: the working tree this file's own H9 numbers above already describe, unchanged
except by this pass's own edits (no commit was made by either worker; still no tag).

**Environment**: Windows 11 (build/test host); WSL Ubuntu (`~/rolo-claude-wt-venv`, pointed at a
live `/mnt/c/...` mount of the SAME working tree via `PYTHONPATH`, NOT the separate, stale
`~/rolo-claude-wt` checkout that predates this pass -- that checkout's own editable pip install
was silently shadowing the live tree and had to be `pip uninstall`-ed first, see "gotchas" below);
the Kali VM (`192.0.2.50`, reachable this time), synced via a `tar` pipe over `ssh` into a
fresh `~/rolo-claude-h9b/rolo-claude` (the repo is private with no stored credentials on the VM,
same limitation the original H9 pass hit), with the SAME stale-editable-install gotcha fixed the
same way.

**Live-Linux checks actually run (not just code-reviewed)**:
- `pgrep`-confirmed on BOTH WSL and Kali: a background Bash job and a real MCP stdio server
  subprocess are both gone after a normal `-p` exit, and after `SIGHUP` (`test_h9b_f03_sighup_...`,
  `test_h9b_mcp_stdio_server_dies_with_the_process_normal_exit_and_sighup`).
- Finding 12 (Linux PATH), on BOTH WSL and Kali, using the review's own reproduction technique:
  `unshare -rm` (no sudo) bind-mounting the REAL Debian/Kali `/etc/profile` (fetched verbatim from
  the Kali VM into `tests/helpers/debian_etc_profile.txt`) over the test host's own `/etc/profile`,
  then running the real CLI inside that namespace -- a PATH-entry tool (`rvtool`, the review's own
  example name) is found by BOTH the foreground and the background Bash path despite the profile's
  unconditional PATH reassignment (`test_h9b_f12_session_path_survives_a_debian_profile_login_shell_reset`).
  This specific pinning test did not exist before this pass -- the finding-12 CODE fix (restoring
  `$PATH` from a harness-private var as the wrapped script's own first line) was already in place,
  but nothing had run the brief's own `unshare -rm` verification for real until now.
- `test_mcp_compat_matrix.py`'s `claude mcp add` <-> `rolo-claude mcp add` interop tests
  (items 6/7/8) against the REAL `claude` binary on WSL: fixed a genuine (if minor) test bug found
  by this verification -- a bare `"python"` command isn't on `$PATH` on a stock Debian/Ubuntu box
  (only `python3` is), so the real `claude mcp list`'s own health check reported `ENOENT`; switched
  to `sys.executable` everywhere in that file (still one argv element, no shell, same round-trip-
  fidelity intent) and confirmed items 6/7/8 pass for real, not skipped.
- `tests/test_tools_read.py::test_read_oversized_image_is_resized_or_omitted` failed for real on a
  Pillow-less WSL venv: its own fixture size (`MAX_IMAGE_DIM + 400` = 1968px) predates finding 19's
  own fix, which deliberately moved the omit-without-Pillow gate from the soft 1568px threshold to
  the hard 8000px one -- so that image now correctly passes through unresized either way, and the
  "no Pillow -> omitted" branch this test wanted to exercise was never reachable any more (masked
  on Windows dev boxes that happen to have Pillow installed). Fixed the fixture to size past
  `MAX_IMAGE_HARD_DIM` instead, which now genuinely exercises both branches on every platform.

**Suites, closing numbers for this pass** (all three green, run at least twice per platform):

| Suite | Windows | WSL Ubuntu | Kali VM |
|---|---|---|---|
| `python tests/run_all.py` | 1458 tests, 1450 passed, 0 failed, 8 skipped, exit 0 | 1458 tests, 1452 passed, 0 failed, 6 skipped, exit 0 | 1458 tests, 1453 passed, 0 failed, 5 skipped, exit 0 |
| `python test_bridge.py` | 97/97 (391 checks), exit 0 | 97/97 (391 checks), exit 0 | 97/97 (391 checks), exit 0 |
| `python test_tui.py` | 43/43, exit 0 | 43/43, exit 0 | 43/43, exit 0 |

The skip-count spread (7/6/5) is platform capability, not flakiness: Windows skips every
POSIX-only `unshare`/`pgrep`/`SIGHUP` test (3 tests) that WSL and Kali both run for real; the
WSL/Kali difference is one pre-existing, unrelated optional-dependency skip. `python -X dev -W
error::ResourceWarning tests/run_all.py` stays clean on Windows after this pass's own fixes too
(same 0-failed count as the plain run, confirming no new unclosed sockets/pipes/files).

**Gotchas hit and fixed while verifying, worth recording for the next Linux pass**: (1) both the
WSL and Kali `~-venv`s had a STALE editable `pip install` of `rolo_claude` pointing at an old,
out-of-sync checkout (`~/rolo-claude-wt`) that silently shadowed `PYTHONPATH` -- always `pip
uninstall rolo_claude` from those venvs before trusting a `PYTHONPATH`-based run against a freshly
synced tree, or re-`pip install -e` against the fresh path. (2) A background job's own marker text
inside a shell COMMENT (`sleep 30 # marker`) never reaches `pgrep -f` on real Linux: a single
simple command as a `bash -lc` script gets bash's own "one command" exec optimization, replacing
`bash` with a bare `sleep 30` and dropping the comment (and "bash") from the process's own argv
entirely -- confirmed empirically with `ps`. A compound script (`sleep 30; : marker`) defeats that
optimization since bash must stay alive to run the second command. (3) A PRE-EXISTING, unrelated
test (`tests/test_cli_flags.py::test_real_sigint_delivers_exit_130_posix`) flaked ONCE on a WSL run
right after a fresh tar re-sync (cold filesystem cache): its own fixed `time.sleep(0.5)` before
sending SIGINT assumed the child process would have finished importing and reached the mock
server by then, which isn't true on a loaded/cold box -- SIGINT arrived before the harness's own
`signal.signal(SIGINT, ...)` installed, so Python's default disposition killed it (`returncode -2`,
not the deliberate `exit(130)` the test wants). Fixed by polling `mock.requests` (populated the
INSTANT a request is received, before the scenario's own artificial delay) instead of a fixed
sleep -- reproduced the original flake was gone across 5 repeats on WSL after the fix, and it
never reproduced on Kali at all (this was a timing race exposed by a cold cache, not a platform-
specific defect).
