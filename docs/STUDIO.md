# Halo Studio

`halo studio` opens your lineups and agent bios as an editable graph in the
browser. It is the visual front door to the same files the wizard and the
CLI edit: a lineup is `~/.halo/teams/<name>.yaml` (or `.halo/teams/` in a
project), a bio is `~/.halo/agents/<name>.yaml`, and Studio reads and writes
them through the exact functions `halo teams` and `halo agents` use. Nothing
is a second source of truth.

```sh
halo studio              # starts a local server, opens the browser
halo studio --no-open    # prints the URL only (SSH, a headless box)
halo studio --port 8765  # a fixed port instead of a free one
```

`/studio` inside the TUI does the same from a live session.

## What you see

- **The rail (left):** every lineup you can reach (shipped, user, project; the
  active one marked), and every agent bio. Drag a bio onto the canvas to add
  an assignment to the open lineup.
- **The canvas:** one card per assignment -- the agent name, its role and
  alias, the model that resolves for it with price and context from the
  catalog, its tool count, a scope badge and a status dot (green valid, amber
  a warning, red a problem; hover reads the text). Edges are **delegation**
  from `main` (labelled with the routing keys that reach a member), **reports
  to** lines from the org section (dashed) and **pipeline** stage order
  (dotted). Pan by dragging, zoom with the wheel, `Shift`-drag to marquee-
  select, `A` lays the graph out again, `F` fits it. Positions are remembered
  per lineup under `~/.halo/studio/layouts/`.
- **The inspector (right):** *Assignment* (agent, role, alias, instances,
  `use_for`, a per-assignment model override), *Agent* (the bio behind the
  card: every section as typed fields, with the "about N turns at this
  price" hint next to the budget), *Lineup* (description, about, and each
  top section -- delegation, routing, budget, escalation, context,
  permissions, org, pipeline, acceptance -- as a YAML body with its
  enforcement badge), *YAML* (the whole file as it will be written; edits go
  both ways).
- **The command palette:** `Ctrl`/`Cmd`+`K` lists every action and every
  lineup and bio; `?` replays the tour.
- **Run view:** overlays the newest session's sub-agents on the cards (which
  node is running, cost so far) and a timeline strip of them. Read-only.

## Validate, save, apply

**Validate** runs `teams_yaml.validate_team_template` (the CLI's own checks)
and redraws the graph. **Save** validates, then writes the YAML to your user
scope (or the project, with the scope toggle in the top bar). A shipped
lineup or bio is never edited in place: saving it writes a copy under the
same name into your scope, which then shadows the shipped one -- exactly
what the wizard's Duplicate does. **Apply** shows the role table it will
write and, on confirm, does what `halo teams use <name>` does: `roles.*`
and `team:` in `~/.halo/config.json`, with custom roles switched on.

Errors are the validator's own lines, shown under the field they name and
in the Lineup tab; a save that fails leaves the file untouched.

## Security model

- The server binds `127.0.0.1` only and refuses any request from a non-
  loopback peer.
- Every API call carries a per-launch token (the `#t=` fragment in the URL
  `halo studio` prints; the page keeps it in session storage and sends it as
  a bearer header). A request without it is a 401.
- A request carrying an `Origin` header that is not this server's own is a
  403, so a page on another site cannot drive Studio even with the port.
- No CDN, no fonts fetched, no analytics: the page is a handful of static
  files served from the package, under a strict content-security policy.
- Writes go only to `~/.halo` (and a project's `.halo/` when you choose that
  scope); shipped files under the package are never written or deleted.

## Over SSH

On a box you reach over SSH (the usual Kali case), run `halo studio
--no-open` there, then on your machine:

```sh
ssh -L 48761:127.0.0.1:48761 <host>
```

using the port Studio printed, and open the printed URL (token included)
in your own browser.

## Files

`halo_harness/studio/server.py` (the server, the guard, the command),
`api.py` (the routes), `model.py` (the graph, the catalog rows, the session
reader), `static/` (the page). Tests: `tests/test_studio_api.py`,
`tests/test_studio_model.py`.
