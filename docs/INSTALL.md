# Install

One install, one command, then `halo` works from any directory -- the same
way `claude` does once it's on PATH. This page is the short version;
[docs/harness/INSTALL.md](harness/INSTALL.md) is the exhaustive one (PEP
668 detail, an offline work-box recipe, per-terminal notes, reproducible
installs via `requirements.lock`).

**Upgrading from a pre-2.0 install (1.0.1)?** The plain install commands
below work as-is, whether or not the 1.0.1 tool is still installed under
its old name -- see "Upgrading from a pre-2.0 install" below for why, and
for the (still recommended, just no longer required) old-tool uninstall
step.

## One line per platform

Prerequisite everywhere: Python 3.10+. [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)
is recommended but optional -- every command below has a plain-`pip`
alternative that needs no `uv` at all.

### Fresh install, nothing downloaded yet (Linux / macOS)

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/roloVibes/Halo-Harness/master/scripts/install-halo.sh | bash
```

`scripts/install-halo.sh` checks for Python 3.10+, installs `uv` if it is
missing, offers to uninstall an old pre-2.0 install (uv, pipx or pip) so
it can never run by mistake, clones to `~/Halo-Harness` (or pulls an
existing clone), runs `uv tool install --reinstall .`, checks PATH, verifies that
`halo` is the installed command, and finishes with `halo doctor`. Options:
`--yes` (no questions), `--no-clone` (install straight from GitHub),
`--dry-run` (print every command it would run -- installs, uninstalls,
clone/pull -- without running any of them; never prompts), `HALO_CLONE_
DIR=/some/dir`. Then `cd ~ && halo init`. The sections below are the same
steps by hand.

### From a clone (recommended -- this is also how you get `git pull` updates)

```sh
git clone https://github.com/roloVibes/Halo-Harness.git
cd Halo-Harness
uv tool install --reinstall .
```

`--reinstall` works whether or not `halo` is already installed, so it is
the ONE command you run both the first time and every later time -- see
"After every `git pull`" below.

No `uv`? `pipx install --force -e .` is the alternative (`pip install
--user -e .` works too) -- `halo`'s own distribution installs exactly one
executable, `halo` itself, so none of these ever touch a separate,
already-installed 1.0.1 tool (see the upgrade note above).
**Kali
2024.x+/Debian trixie+ enable PEP 668**, so a bare `pip install --user`
refuses with `error: externally-managed-environment` on system Python;
`uv tool install`/`pipx install` both sidestep it entirely (they install
into an isolated environment, never system/apt Python), which is why
they're listed first.

### Directly from GitHub (no clone at all)

```sh
uv tool install git+https://github.com/roloVibes/Halo-Harness
```

Nothing to `cd` into first -- good for a box that only ever needs to RUN
`halo`, never to `git pull` it. You cannot update this install with `git
pull` (there is no local clone); re-run the same command to pick up a new
release instead.

### Windows

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/roloVibes/Halo-Harness/master/scripts/install-halo.ps1 | iex"
```

Mirrors `install-halo.sh` exactly: installs `uv` if missing, offers to
uninstall an old pre-2.0 install (uv, pipx or pip), clones to
`%USERPROFILE%\Halo-Harness` (or pulls an existing clone), runs `uv tool
install --reinstall .`, checks PATH, and finishes with `halo doctor`.
Same options too: `-Yes`, `-NoClone`, `-DryRun`, `-CloneDir <path>`. By
hand, from PowerShell:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/roloVibes/Halo-Harness.git
cd Halo-Harness
uv tool install --reinstall .
cd ~
halo init
```

## Then: cd anywhere, type `halo`

```sh
cd ~                 # or /tmp, or any other project directory at all
halo init            # one time: a wizard -- provider, local models, model, permission mode, theme, roles, orgs, doctor, pong
halo                 # full-screen TUI -- reads THIS directory's CLAUDE.md, rules, settings, .mcp.json
```

`halo init`'s wizard has Back/Skip/Next buttons and never exits to the
console between steps; `halo setup roles`/`halo setup orgs` reopen its
Roles/Organizations screens later without repeating the provider steps.

That's the whole point of installing it: `halo`, once on PATH, is a real
console script, not a script that only works from inside this checkout --
run it from your home directory, `/tmp`, or any project, and it reads
*that* directory's `CLAUDE.md` chain, `.claude/rules`, project/local
settings, `.mcp.json`, skills, commands and agents, exactly the way
`claude` does, plus the user-level files under `~/.claude` as always.
`halo doctor`'s "command on PATH" check (and `init`'s own summary line)
names which copy of `halo` you're actually running and says so plainly
when it ISN'T the installed one -- see docs/harness/INSTALL.md's own
"Verify" section.

## The clone directory is for `git pull` only

Once installed, the checkout you cloned has exactly one job left: pulling
future updates. It is never needed again to RUN `halo` -- there is no
"run it from inside the checkout" mode you're supposed to use day to day
(`bin/halo`/`bin/halo.cmd` inside it are a fallback for a box with no
install done yet at all, not the normal path).

### After every `git pull`

```sh
cd /path/to/Halo-Harness   # back in the clone, for this one step only
git pull
uv tool install --reinstall .      # or: pipx install --force -e .
cd ~                                # done -- back to running `halo` from anywhere
```

The exact same reinstall command as the first install, every time --
`halo doctor`/`halo init`'s PATH check names this command for your box if
you ever forget and the installed copy drifts out of date.

## Update

```sh
halo update            # or /update inside halo
```

`halo update --check` prints installed vs. available and the exact
command for however `halo` was installed, then (unless `--check`) runs
it and reports the before/after commit by re-running `halo --version`.
The manual command, per install kind: `uv tool install --reinstall
<spec>` (uv tool), `pipx install --force <spec>` (pipx), `python -m pip
install --upgrade <spec>` (pip), `git pull` then the same reinstall
(editable checkout), or plain `git pull` (bare checkout on PYTHONPATH).

**Windows note:** close other `halo` sessions first -- the install can't
be replaced while any of them still has it open. `/update` inside the
TUI does this for you: `Enter` quits, updates (output visible in the
terminal), and relaunches with `--continue` so the session resumes;
`halo update` run on its own refuses with the same reason when another
session is running (`--force` overrides once you're sure none is
actually using the install).

## Uninstall

```sh
uv tool uninstall halo-harness      # or: pipx uninstall halo-harness
                                     # or: pip uninstall halo-harness
rm -rf ~/.halo                      # optional -- state, sessions, cached catalogs
```

A clone made for `git pull` (not needed to RUN `halo`, see above) can
just be deleted too.

## Upgrading from a pre-2.0 install (1.0.1)

`halo` is a rename, not a fresh product -- 1.0.1's installed console
script still carries the previous project's name. As of 2.0.1, `halo`'s
own distribution ships exactly one executable (`halo` itself, never a
second entry under the old name), so installing it never aborts or
conflicts with a still-installed 1.0.1 tool. Uninstalling the old tool
first is still recommended, so the stale command can't run by mistake --
`halo doctor` WARNs if one is still on PATH and prints the exact
uninstall command for whatever it finds. See
[docs/harness/INSTALL.md's "Upgrading from a pre-2.0 install"](harness/INSTALL.md#upgrading-from-a-pre-20-install-101)
for the uninstall command per installer and what happens to the old
state directory (renamed to `~/.halo`, no link left behind, so the
separate 1.0.1 install must not be run again afterward).

## Verify

```sh
halo --version          # halo 2.0.1
halo doctor              # read-only environment check -- every WARN/MISSING line names its own fix
```

**On an Apple Silicon Mac**, once the install above is verified, see
[docs/MAC.md](MAC.md) for a full quick-start covering the Mac's own
Ollama daemon and the optional, experimental `uv tool install
"halo-harness[mlx]"` extra (`hf:mlx/<org>/<repo>`, round 5f) -- off by
default and only installable on macOS/arm64 in the first place.

**For local models (Ollama, Hugging Face) and the OpenAI API/Codex
subscription routes**, see [docs/LOCAL-MODELS.md](LOCAL-MODELS.md) for
the end-to-end guide once `halo` itself is installed.

See the [README](../README.md) for the 10-minute walkthrough and
[docs/harness/INSTALL.md](harness/INSTALL.md) for everything this page
doesn't cover: offline/work-box installs, Windows detail, PATH
troubleshooting, and per-terminal notes for the TUI.
