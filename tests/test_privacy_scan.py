"""tests.test_privacy_scan -- W5 (2026-10-02, from the first privacy pass;
see plans/2.0.9-review-privacy-brief.md section C) and its W5b follow-up:
guards the content scrub `tests/helpers/fake_home.py`, `test_memory.py`,
`test_frontmatter.py`, `test_loop_headless.py`, `test_mcp_catalog.py`,
`test_paths.py`, `docs/harness/ACCEPTANCE-2026-09-25.md` and
`docs/harness/INSTALL.md` just went through so it cannot quietly
regress. Scans the TRACKED tree only (`git ls-files` -- history is a
separate, already-reviewed question, see the privacy brief's section B)
for: LAN addresses, two specific real home paths, the exact machine/
project/hobby-gear/work-tool names this pass removed, and key-shaped
fragments outside `tests/privacy_scan_allowlist.txt`'s known fakes.

Deliberately narrower than `tests/test_docs_hygiene.py`'s own home-path/
Databricks-host checks once applied past docs/: those two generic checks
false-positive constantly across the wider tree (`C:\\Users\\example\\...`-
style fixture paths and dozens of distinct FAKE Databricks hostnames are
normal and expected throughout tests/ -- confirmed by hand before writing
this file). What's banned here instead is the SPECIFIC real strings this
pass actually found and removed -- precise enough to regress-guard them
without re-litigating every generic placeholder the suite already uses on
purpose.
