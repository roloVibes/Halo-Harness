"""halo_harness.bg_run -- W4a/W5 CLI flags: `--bg`/`--background` (spawn
this same invocation detached, print an id + log path, state under
`<state>/bg/<id>/{output.log,meta.json}`) and `--tmux` (re-exec inside a
new tmux window when tmux exists; no iTerm2-native-pane backend). W5
(carried from W4a) adds the read/manage side over those SAME run
directories -- `list_runs`/`pid_alive`/`kill_pid` below, driven by
`bg_cli.cmd_bg`'s own `halo bg list|logs|stop|rm` (kept in a separate
module, same split as `mcp_setup.py`/`mcp_cli.py`: this file stays
argparse-free and directly unit-testable).

Kept as its own module (not inline in cli.py) so both are unit-testable
without going through argparse/subprocess-spawning-a-real-python at all --
`start_background_run`'s own argv-to-Popen-args translation and `run_in_tmux`'s
tmux-missing fallback are the parts worth pinning directly.
