"""halo_harness.roles -- Halo 2.0.2 (W7 round 1, brief A "roles v2"),
carrying forward V2c (H15): the `roles` table a built-in/custom sub-agent's
own role (a frontmatter `role:` key, an `Agent(role=...)` call-time
override, or a built-in's own fixed default) resolves a MODEL (and now an
EFFORT) from, `--role NAME=MODEL[:EFFORT]` CLI overrides, `team.json`'s own
`roles` map seeded into `~/.halo/config.json` (the exact idiom `team_config.
apply_gateway_preference` already uses for `gateway_preference`), a loaded
`~/.halo/roles/<name>.json` TEMPLATE (new this round), and `/roles`'s own
table rendering (model, effort, endpoint/path type, price per role). See
`docs/ROLES.md`.

Precedence a role-aware agent's model actually resolves through (full chain,
`config/agents_md.py::resolve_agent_model`): invocation `model=` > a CLI
`--role` override for THIS agent's own role > the agent file's own `model:`
> this module's role table (persisted config.json -- itself already layered
CLI-template-over-team.json-over-local by whoever builds the session, or the
cost-aware default below) for that role > `CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL`/
`settings.subagentModel` > `role_table["subagent_default"]` (new this round,
ONLY for a sub-agent with no role name at all) > the parent/session model.
`orchestrator` needs no entry at all to mean "the session model" -- that IS
what an absent/empty role-table lookup already falls through to.

A role table VALUE (config.json/team.json/template/`--role`) is either a
bare model-reference string, or `{"model": "...", "effort": "..."}` --
`_role_value_parts` below is the one place every caller unpacks either shape
into a plain `(model, effort)` pair; nothing else in this module (or
anywhere that reads a role table) should pattern-match the raw value itself.

Role NAMES are no longer a closed set: `ROLE_NAMES` below are the built-ins
(every one wired to a built-in agent, a system subsystem, or both -- see
`docs/ROLES.md`), but any OTHER syntactically-valid name (`[a-z][a-z0-9_]*`)
that a team.json or a loaded roles template actually defines a value for is
an equally valid role for `Agent(role=...)`, `--role`, and frontmatter
`role:` -- `known_role_names()` is the live "what's valid right now" set
every validation point checks a name against.
