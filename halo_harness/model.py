"""halo_harness.model -- model reference parsing and profile resolution for
the harness's own agent loop (plan D3). This sits ABOVE the proxy's own
providers.routing.route_model/resolve_profile: `ModelRef` is a richer parse
(keeps the `or:`/`dbx:`/`ant:` prefixes and bare vendor/model or
databricks-*/system.ai.* forms, PLUS a `routes.json` "aliases" table so a
short name like "sonnet" can resolve to a real ref) and `ModelProfile` adds
vision/reasoning/pricing on top of the proxy's plain
context_tokens/max_output_tokens pair -- all sourced from the SAME
models.json + routes.json the proxy already writes/reads
(providers/databricks.py's load_models_json, providers/config.py's
load_routes), so the harness and the proxy never disagree about a model's
capabilities.

class CostMeter:
    """Accumulates a session's cost across turns. OpenRouter reports actual
    USD cost per response (when the request carried `"usage":{"include":true}`,
    which providers.translate.anthropic_to_openai does not set today -- H4's
    "cost meter" milestone item is what wires that request flag AND reads
    the resulting `usage.cost` field; until then every OpenRouter turn is
    also `None`/unknown, exactly like Databricks, so `has_cost_data` starts
    True and simply never flips to a real number in H0 -- that's expected,
    not a bug). Databricks never reports a raw `usage.cost` field on the
    wire at all, on any gateway dialect -- but since 1.0.1 hotfix 14, when
    this session's `ModelProfile` resolved a real per-token price for the
    Databricks endpoint (a models.dev `databricks` catalog entry; see
    `resolve_model_profile`'s three-tier chain above), `_fallback_cost`
    below computes a real running cost for it exactly like any other
    provider. Still "n/a" whenever no such price was resolved, which
    remains the common case for most endpoints.

    H5 scope D: when a response has no `usage.cost` (an OpenRouter reply
    that genuinely omitted it, or ANY other host/route -- `ant:`, Databricks
    Claude passthrough, a plain openai-chat gateway with no cost field),
    `_fallback_cost` applies OpenCode's own formula (Appendix G) --
    `input*price_in + output*price_out + reasoning*price_out` (reasoning
    billed at the OUTPUT rate), plus, since H5c, `cache_read*price_cache_read
    + cache_write*price_cache_write` as their OWN line items -- but ONLY
    when this meter was actually constructed with real per-token pricing
    (`price_in`/`price_out`, normally `ModelProfile.price_in`/`price_out`
    from models.json); with neither `usage.cost` nor pricing, behaviour is
    unchanged from before (`has_cost_data` flips False -- "n/a"). H5c Extra
    (from the H8 must-do list): `price_cache_read`/`price_cache_write` are
    optional independently of `price_in`/`price_out` -- a source with plain
    input/output pricing but no cache breakdown (most vendored/fallback
    rows) still gets a real fallback cost, with cache tokens folded into
    the ordinary `price_in` rate (never $0 -- the documented approximation
    this replaces only when the SPECIFIC cache rate isn't known); not the
