"""halo_harness.tui.bootstrap -- builds a real `agent.loop.Session` +
`controller.Controller` for an interactive TUI launch.

u2-h3b finding 9: this used to be its own ~190-line hand-copy of
`headless.py.run_print_mode`'s setup (kept "in spirit" only, per this
module's old docstring) -- and it had already drifted: no server-level
`alwaysLoad`, no "keep ToolSearch when the deferred pool is non-empty"
rule, so `halo --tools Read,Bash` left every deferred MCP tool
unreachable in the TUI while the prompt still said "call ToolSearch".
Both entry points now build through `headless.build_session` (the ONE
shared builder) and can never drift like that again; this module's own
job shrinks to translating `args` (an argparse.Namespace) into that
function's keyword arguments, then wrapping the result in a `Controller`
plus the TUI's own `/mcp` status+reconnect closures.
