"""halo_harness.tui.app -- `BridgeApp`, the full-screen Textual UI (D-TUI

prompt row (glyph + `PromptInput`) and `StatusBar` dock the bottom. A 30 Hz
`_drain` timer pulls events from `controller.events` (a real `Controller`'s
queue, filled by its worker thread) AND `self._local_events` (fed
synchronously by `submit()` for a scripted `FakeController`, which returns
its events directly rather than through a queue) with an 8 ms budget,
coalesces them (`tui/events.py::drain_queue`), and applies each one
(`tui/dispatch.py::apply_event`) -- the ONLY code path that ever touches a
widget, so nothing here is ever called from another thread.

        only ever CONSUMES a key here (the live continuation of a pending
        chord) -- everything else is left for that automatic base
        dispatch to handle on its own, completely untouched.

        """1.0.1 hotfix 15.6: Ctrl+Q exits even when the session/transcript
        is wedged (a hang neither Ctrl+C nor a card can recover from) --
        `_quit_worker` above calls `controller.quit()` and waits on it with
        NO bound, so a genuinely hung controller (a stuck permission wait, a
        subprocess that won't die) means even double-Ctrl+C's own quit path
        never actually exits. This gives `controller.quit()` a 2s head
        start on its own daemon thread, then calls `self.exit()` regardless
        of whether it finished.

        1.0.1 fixpass finding 5: gated on its OWN `_force_quitting` flag,
        never `_quitting` -- the exact case this exists for is double-
        Ctrl+C/`/quit` having ALREADY set `_quitting` and started the
        unbounded `_quit_worker` (now hung); the old shared flag made THIS
        action a no-op in exactly that moment, the one time it's needed."""
