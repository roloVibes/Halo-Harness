"""halo_harness.agent.cc_runtime -- H11 Part B: turn execution for a `cc:`
route Session -- lazily starts one `ClaudeCodeProcess` + `ToolBridgeServer`
pair per session, drives one turn (stream-json user line in, events out),
and runs the bridge's own "normal dispatch path" for every
`mcp__rolo__<Name>` call Claude Code makes.

H11b rewrite: the bridge's dispatch is now LITERALLY the loop's own
dispatch -- `bridge_call_tool` builds a trivial (already-valid, Claude
Code's own MCP client validated it) `RepairOutcome` and calls
`Session._resolve_tool_call` + `Session._finalize_tool_result` directly,
so permission decide, PreToolUse/PermissionRequest/PermissionDenied
hooks, the loop breaker, EnterPlanMode/ExitPlanMode, AskUserQuestion and
Agent/Task all behave EXACTLY as they do for every other route (findings
3, 13, 17) -- see `_resolve_and_dispatch_bridged_call`'s own docstring.

Steering (critical finding 1): claude runs with `--replay-user-messages`,
so every stdin line we send -- the turn's own line and any steer -- is
echoed back verbatim as `{"type":"user","isReplay":true,...}` once claude
actually starts consuming it (live-verified against 2.1.284: a line sent
while claude is still busy is NOT echoed until claude is ready for it,
which may be well after an EARLIER line's own `result`). `CcState.
unconfirmed` is a FIFO of lines sent but not yet echoed; a rolo turn ends
at a `result` only once that FIFO is empty -- correct whether claude
absorbs a steer into the turn already running (one result covers both,
FIFO empties before that one result) or answers it as a genuine follow-up
turn (a `result` that arrives while the FIFO still isn't empty is NOT the
end; more is coming).

Threading model, per turn: the CALLING thread (the Session's own worker
thread) runs `turn_body_cc`; a background READER thread parses stdout
into events; a background WATCHER thread turns `session.abort` into a
subprocess interrupt; the bridge's own connection thread(s) run
`bridge_call_tool` synchronously whenever Claude Code calls a tool. All
three feed ONE per-turn queue so `yield` order matches real-time arrival.

    the `cc:` route v2 control channel): when the installed claude's
    control channel is available, sends `control_request` `interrupt`
    FIRST and waits (bounded) for its `control_response` -- cutting the
    reply already in progress cleanly, the same shape every other
    route's own steer already has -- before falling through to v1's
    unchanged send below. `state.expect_interrupted_result` tells
    `_events_for_stdout_obj` to not treat the (now-cut) turn's own
    `result` as a real error. On an older child with no control channel
    (or a timed-out/failed interrupt), falls straight through to v1's
    behaviour unchanged: send the steer text alone and let Claude Code
    queue it on its own terms ("queued for Claude Code") -- see
    `agent/cc_control.py` for the channel-detection/request/response
    plumbing this calls into.

    Finding 1 (unchanged): NOT logged here either way -- a steer becomes
    a session-log "steer" node only once `turn_body_cc`'s reader sees the
    `--replay-user-messages` echo, never ahead of output it did not
    influence.

    Round 4b fix (the race this function used to lose on a fast box,
    deterministically on Linux, intermittently on CI, almost never on a
    slower Windows subprocess start): the FIFO entry is now registered
    in `state.unconfirmed` BEFORE the control-channel round trip above,
    never after. The control-channel wait is bounded but real (up to
    3s on a child that never answers at all -- an old claude, or this
    repo's own hermetic fake with `FAKE_CLAUDE_CC_CONTROL` unset); the
    turn's own reader thread (`turn_body_cc`) treats a `result` as DONE
    the moment `state.unconfirmed` is empty. With the entry added only
    AFTER that wait (the old order), a short-lived turn's own genuine
    `result` could arrive and find `unconfirmed` already empty -- the
    reader would conclude the turn was over and exit BEFORE this
    function ever got to append the entry or send the line, so the
    steer that follows is orphaned: sent into a process nothing on our
    side is reading anymore, never logged, and (since the turn's own
    generator has already finished) `session.busy` drops, so a SECOND
    queued steer right behind it is then rejected outright. Registering
    the entry first closes that window: the reader sees `unconfirmed`
    non-empty for as long as this function hasn't yet decided whether
    to interrupt, so it keeps reading instead of ending the turn, and
    the steer -- sent the v1 way regardless of the control-channel
    outcome -- is always still delivered and still logged once its own
    echo arrives, whether that's into the turn already running or a
    follow-up round after it. Never platform-specific code: both
    platforms share this exact path; only subprocess/MCP-handshake
    startup speed (fast on Linux, often slow enough on Windows to
    finish the control wait first) decided whether the window above was
    ever actually hit."""
