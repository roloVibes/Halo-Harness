"""halo_harness.agent.escalation -- Halo 2.0.3 round 5e: hybrid escalation
as an explicit policy (`routing.escalation` in `~/.halo/config.json`).
Local first: a configured policy only ever matters on a local-model session
(`model.is_local_model_ref`) -- never on a cloud-model one (`Session.
_maybe_escalate`, agent/loop.py, checks this before anything here runs).

No new judging mechanism (brief's own words): the `low_confidence` trigger
reuses the EXACT role-resolution + one-shot-call shape `Session.
call_small_model` already established for the `small` role, just pointed at
the `judge` role instead (`roles.resolve_role_ref("judge", ...)` -- the
same role every decision-only/judge-endpoint routing in this codebase
already resolves through, see `roles.py`'s own `ROLE_NAMES` docstring);
`tool_failures` counts the current turn's own `is_error=True` tool_result
log nodes (no separate counter mechanism -- `count_tool_failures_since`
below is a pure read of the log the session already keeps); `context_
overflow` is the existing `providers.stream.ContextOverflow` path's own
per-turn counter (`Session._turn_context_overflow_count`, incremented at
the two call sites that already catch it).

This module holds the pure, Session-independent pieces (policy loading,
per-role override, the tool-failure count, the judge-reply parse, the
decision record shape) so each is unit-testable with no live Session/model
at all; the stateful "evaluate this turn, act on it" logic lives on
`Session` itself (agent/loop.py), since it needs the log, the role table,
`call_small_model`, and `set_model`.
