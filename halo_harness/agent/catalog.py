"""halo_harness.agent.catalog -- SessionCatalog (H3 scope C, plan revision
4): the frozen tool catalog + lazy load over deferred MCP tools.

Freezing happens ONCE, before a session's first model call: built-ins +
MCP tools (already filtered by server-scoped permission deny rules) split
into "preload" (an MCP tool's own `_meta[anthropic/alwaysLoad]`, or a wire
name listed in `~/.halo/config.json`'s `mcpPreload`) vs "deferred"
(everything else, reachable only through ToolSearch), respecting the
provider's tools_max (32 Databricks / 128 OpenRouter --
providers/profiles.py). Growth from a ToolSearch load is APPEND-ONLY to an
explicit ordered name list independent of `ToolRegistry.definitions()`'s
own (always-alphabetical) ordering -- that list stays sorted for the
INITIAL freeze and for "what's loadable" listings, but is never consulted
again for WIRE-catalog order once a session exists; `SessionCatalog.names`
is what `agent/loop.py`'s `Session` logs as each new `meta` node's `tools`,
so `derive_request` reconstructs the SAME growing-but-never-reordered list
every replay (finding 4: "adding a tool is an accepted one-time cache
miss, never reorder").
