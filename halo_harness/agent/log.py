"""halo_harness.agent.log -- the append-only session log (H1 scope E): the
SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH every model request is derived from. Replaces
agent/session_store.py's role in the loop (that module is left in the tree,
unreferenced, rather than deleted, since nothing outside it imports it after
this milestone and deleting working code isn't this brief's job).

dsh's own architecture doc states the invariant this module exists to make
checkable: "Model-visible means logged. Anything that reaches a model
request must be reconstructable from the log, and a runtime invariant
asserts it." `agent/derive.py` is the reconstruction half; this module is
the storage half.

Node types: meta, system, user, assistant (content blocks incl. raw
thinking/reasoning), tool_result, snapshot (dynamic context delivered as a
user-role block: permission mode, CLAUDE.md chain, memory index, skills,
notices), usage, error, interrupted, compacted (H5: a pure shadow-range
marker -- see `append_compacted` and `agent/derive.py`).
