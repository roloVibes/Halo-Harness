"""halo_harness.agent.subagent -- the Agent/Task tool's real implementation
(H6 scope B): `AgentRuntime` (what a session's Agent-tool calls need beyond
a bare ToolContext), spawning a child `agent.loop.Session` per call with a
fresh log under `<parent_session_dir>/subagents/agent-<id>.jsonl` (+ a
`.meta.json` beside it), depth-1 + <=4-concurrent enforcement, background
completion delivered as a user-role notice on the PARENT's next turn (dsh:
"background jobs ... report completion as a user-role notice in the next
step"), resumable `task_id` (`<task_result task_id="...">` wrapping, OpenCode
adopt item), and SubagentStart/SubagentStop hook firing (tagged with the
child's own `agent_id`/`agent_type` via its own HookRunner).

`agent/loop.py`'s `_dispatch_tools` calls `run_agent_call` DIRECTLY (a
dedicated code path, like AskUserQuestion/ExitPlanMode -- never through the
generic `tool_registry.dispatch()`) so it can run several calls
CONCURRENTLY (a real `ThreadPoolExecutor`, up to `MAX_CONCURRENT_AGENTS`)
and still forward every child event, tagged, into the parent's own event
stream once the batch completes. `tools/agent.py`'s `AgentTool.run()` calls
the SAME function as a correctness fallback for any caller that dispatches
it generically instead (a unit test, or a future caller) -- it still does
the real work, just without the intermediate child events being visible.

H5c finding 8: a FOREGROUND child session's own permission "ask" is now
surfaced LIVE (an agent-tagged, answerable `permission_request` card),
never auto-denied, whenever the PARENT is interactive -- `child.
_subagent_live_asks` (set below, deliberately never `child.interactive`
itself, which also gates AskUserQuestion/ExitPlanMode -- out of this
finding's scope and would otherwise hang a child forever on those, since
only `_permission_waiters` is shared, not `_question_waiters`/
`_plan_waiters`) and a shared `_permission_waiters` dict (same pattern as
the shared `abort` Event) are what make this possible: the child's own
`_resolve_tool_call` parks its waiter in the SAME dict the PARENT's
`resolve_permission` (the UI's `Controller.answer_permission`) already
reads from, so the existing card-answer plumbing needs no changes at all.
This REQUIRES `_run_child_to_completion` to stream every child event live
(the `on_event` callback below) rather than buffer the whole turn into a
list first -- a child blocked waiting for its own permission answer would
never finish "buffering" in the first place, so its `permission_request`
would never reach anything. A BACKGROUND child (`run_in_background`/
`spec.background`) is deliberately EXCLUDED (`_subagent_live_asks` stays
False for it): its events are never forwarded to any live stream at all
(see `_bg_run`'s own `del child_events` below), so a live card for it
would have nowhere to be shown and would just hang the background thread
-- it keeps the old immediate-denial fallback instead. Print mode (`-p`,
`parent.interactive` False) also keeps the old fallback for every child,
foreground or not: deny + `permission_denials`, exactly like Claude
Code's own "print mode -> deny" rule for every session, not just `-p`
itself.

    reference down the WHOLE tree (`AgentRuntime.concurrency_semaphore`,
    propagated by `_build_child_session`/`run_org_call` exactly like
    `org_budget` already is), acquired around each child's own run in
    EVERY spawn path -- single, fan-out, resume -- so the session-/org-
    wide concurrency cap is real: two separate `count` calls in one turn
    (or nested levels) can no longer multiply past it just because each
    one's own `ThreadPoolExecutor` pool is independently sized.

    Deliberately NOT a bare `threading.Semaphore`: a child delegating to
    a grandchild is logically one more hop of the SAME call already
    holding a slot, but PHYSICALLY it runs on a brand new pool-worker
    thread -- even a lone Agent tool_use goes through `agent/loop.py`'s
    `_run_agent_batch`, which always builds its own `ThreadPoolExecutor`
    (`max_workers=min(cap, 1)` for exactly one call). A bare semaphore
    sized below the nesting depth deadlocks: the OUTER thread blocks
    waiting (`queue.Queue.get()`) for the inner pool's worker to finish,
    while that worker blocks waiting for the very slot the outer thread
    is holding. Verified directly (a traced plain-semaphore substitute
    produced exactly this hang on a 2-level chain at cap=1).

    Fixed with EXPLICIT nesting-depth handoff across the thread
    boundary: `wrap_for_pool`, called on the SUBMITTING thread right
    before `pool.submit`, captures that thread's current depth and
    returns a wrapper which seeds the SAME depth onto whichever worker
    thread the pool actually runs it on (restored afterward, since pool
    threads are reused across unrelated later jobs). A plain `threading.

    existing session id) starts with it EMPTY -- every task_id the model
    remembers from before the restart would otherwise come back "Unknown
    task_id", even though its child log and meta.json are sitting right
    there on disk. Runs at most ONCE per runtime (guarded by
    `tasks_hydrated`, checked/set under `runtime.lock` alongside every
    other mutation of `runtime.tasks`): globs THIS session's own
    `subagents/agent-*.meta.json` -- the exact directory `_child_log_paths`

    mid-flight along with the old process; there is no live thread left
    anywhere to signal, abort or race against. `tools/task_stop.py` checks
    `abort_event is None` and reports it as nothing-to-stop rather than
