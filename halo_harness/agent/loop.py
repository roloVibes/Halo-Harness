"""halo_harness.agent.loop -- the agent loop (H1 rewrite, scope E-H; H2
must-do 3-6 + findings 1-16 layered on top).

Every model request is DERIVED from the append-only SessionLog
(agent/log.py + agent/derive.py) -- `self.messages` (H0's ad-hoc
in-memory list) is gone. Real tool dispatch (tools/registry.py), the loop
breaker (rule 8), serialize-time invariants on interrupt/error
(agent/invariants.py), canonical Anthropic block accumulation (accumulate
`partial_json`, decode once at content_block_stop -- finding 12), and
per-profile reasoning replay via providers/request.py + providers/hooks.py.

H2: `_derive_and_build` derives tools from the logged FROZEN catalog
(finding 4), `_step` hashes the EXACT body sent (finding 4), catches
`ToolCatalogTooLarge` (must-do 4), retries on a real 1-2-4-8-16s/max-5
ladder with an abort-aware wait (finding 7), retries one empty completion
before failing (finding 7), treats `length_with_minimal_output` as a
provider failure (finding 3), and passes `Session.abort` into
`stream_completion` so a future interrupt source can cut phase 2 (and,
via `providers/stream.py`'s connect-time watcher, phase 1) short
(must-do 5). `_turn_body` counts MODEL CALLS (not `turn()` calls) against
`--max-turns` (finding 9) and gives a length-truncated/malformed tool call
its own `is_error` result instead of silently ending the turn
(finding 3).

        pair was already attempted THIS PROCESS (`_ollama_calibrate_
        attempted`, in-memory only -- see `__init__`'s own comment for why
        that's enough); (2) `BRIDGE_TEST_NO_BACKGROUND_NET` (never touches
        the network in a hermetic test); (3) `ollama.auto_calibrate: false`
        (brief's own opt-out) or an entry already on disk (a different
        process already measured this pair, or an earlier `halo ollama
        calibrate` did). Any exception anywhere in this path is swallowed
        and logged at DEBUG -- a failed calibration attempt must never
        block the ordinary turn it was trying to help.

        Review fix pass (finding 8): ONLY called from `_derive_and_build`
        (the main turn) and `_run_compaction` now -- `call_small_model`
        (titles, hooks, `/local <question>`, the escalation judge) skips
        it entirely (`_build_ollama_body_for_ref`'s own `auto_calibrate`
        flag), since that method's OWN `timeout_s` budget used to start
        only AFTER this ran, so a slow/asleep host silently ate the small
        model's entire caller-visible budget before the small model's own
        request was ever sent.

        The actual measurement (`run_auto_calibration`, several `/api/
        chat` + `/api/ps` round trips) runs in a background daemon thread
        -- this method waits for it, but ONLY up to `budget_s` AND only
        while `self.abort` stays clear, polling both every 0.2s. Either
        one firing first means "stop waiting", not "stop measuring": no
        abort hook reaches this deep into the HTTP layer to cut an
        in-flight request off mid-socket-read (`providers.stream`'s own
        `_phase1_abort_watcher`/`sock_box` is the one place in this
        codebase that does, for the one stream a turn is actually
        waiting on) -- so the measurement keeps running and still records
        its result for a LATER turn to find via `has_calibration_entry`
        (which is why the dedupe flag above is set unconditionally,
        BEFORE this wait, not after: a second concurrent/later call for
        the SAME pair must never pile another measurement on top of one
        already in flight). The notice is simply not shown for THIS turn
        when the wait times out or aborts first -- never queued late,
        since `_pending_ollama_notices` is read from this same thread's

        trained-context/context-ownership-sync dance inline. Resolves
        `ref.host` against `ollama.hosts` -- a missing entry raises
        `ProviderNotConfigured` naming the ref's host and `ollama.hosts`
        rather than silently falling back to some other host -- then
        reads the model's trained context from the (cached, short-TTL)
        catalog, with ANY exception or an unreachable host swallowed to
        `None` (round 3's fit-estimate wiring is the only other input
        `compute_num_ctx` takes; this round never fails a turn over a
        best-effort catalog probe). Only when `ref is self.model_ref`

        other model) does a successful build also sync `self.model_profile.

        model`'s own call site, below) skips `_maybe_auto_calibrate_
        ollama` entirely -- that method's own background-thread wait has
        a real total budget now, but a small-model call (a title, a
        hook's verdict, `/local <question>`, the escalation judge) is
        still the wrong BUDGET to spend it from: those callers' own

        review finding 14: three things used to go silently stale here --
        (a) every already-loaded `McpTool.vision` flag (a switch away
        from a vision model kept sending logged screenshots as
        `image_url` parts a text-only endpoint rejects), (b) the
        SessionCatalog's tool-count CAP (OpenRouter 128 -> Databricks 32
        made every later request fail with `tool_catalog_too_large` once
        enough ToolSearch loads had accumulated past the new, smaller
        cap) -- fixed by re-gating vision and LRU-evicting down to fit,
        and (c) no log record of the switch at all -- a `meta` node now
        carries the new model + the (possibly just-shrunk) tool list, the
        same shape `_on_catalog_grow` already logs.

        H11 Part B: switching INTO cc: mid-session (provider WASN'T "cc",
        now is) stashes the prior log as one `<conversation-so-far>` user
        message for the next fresh claude subprocess start to prime with
        (documented v1 behaviour -- see agent/cc_runtime.py's
        `prepare_conversation_so_far`). Switching AWAY from cc: needs no
        special handling at all: every cc: turn already logged ordinary
        user/assistant/tool_result nodes, so `derive_request` picks them
        up as history exactly like any other route's own turns.

        H11b finding 10: a cc:->cc: MODEL change (e.g. `/model cc:opus`
        then `/model cc:sonnet`) and a cc:->other switch both close the
        live claude subprocess (it can't hot-swap `--model` mid-stream) --
        `_cc_state` is dropped but the log's own `cc_session_id` meta node
        is left alone, so the NEXT `cc:` turn's `ensure_cc_state`
        naturally restarts with `--resume <same id> --model <new model>`,
        continuing the SAME claude conversation under the new model. A
        cc:->or:->cc: round trip (the live process was never closed, just
        idle) reuses that same still-alive process, so `prepare_
        conversation_so_far` alone would leave its own `<conversation-so-
        far>` stashed but unsent forever -- `ensure_cc_state`'s reuse path
