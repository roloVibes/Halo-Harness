    """Halo 2.0.2 round C: "connection refused and DNS failure fail fast
    (well under a second) instead of waiting out MCP_TIMEOUT". Verified
    directly against the installed MCP SDK: `streamable_http_client`'s
    own context-manager entry (what `connect_timeout`/`task_timeout`
    below actually wrap) is LAZY -- it returns in well under a second
    regardless of whether anything is even listening -- so neither
    `connect_http` nor `connect_sse`'s own timeout ever caught a dead
    server at all; the real first network round trip only happens later
    inside `ClientSession.initialize()` (called from `mcp/manager.py`,
    outside this module entirely), which then blocks on a low-level
    anyio memory-stream wait that a raw `asyncio.Task.cancel()` (this
    same codebase's own `mcp.client.task_timeout`) could NOT reliably
    interrupt within its configured window either (verified: it still
    hadn't returned after the window had long since passed). Rather than
    fight that SDK-internal cancellation gap, this runs a plain stdlib-
    shaped TCP connect attempt BEFORE any of that -- verified to raise
    promptly and cleanly on both failure shapes (a closed port: a real
    `ConnectionRefusedError` in a couple of seconds on Windows loopback,
    almost certainly faster on Linux/the project's primary platform; a
    bad hostname: `socket.gaierror` in well under a second).

    Raises `ConnectionRefusedError` ONLY for a CONFIRMED refusal/DNS
    failure (any `OSError`, which covers both). Returns normally (never
    raises) for anything else this can't confirm either way: no host in
    the URL, this probe's OWN `timeout` elapsing (inconclusive -- a
    genuinely slow-but-reachable server must still get its usual, longer
    chance via the real connect attempt that follows, unchanged), or any
    other surprise -- a false positive here would wrongly fail a server
    this was never meant to touch at all.

    finding 46: a direct `asyncio.open_connection(host, port)` ignores
    `HTTP(S)_PROXY`/`http(s)_proxy` entirely -- behind an egress proxy the
    real connect (`connect_http`/`connect_sse`, both via `httpx`) reaches
    the server THROUGH the proxy and may work fine, while this probe dials
    `host:port` directly and sees a refusal/timeout that says nothing
    about whether the server is actually reachable. Skipped outright
    (same "inconclusive -- let the real connect attempt decide" return as
    every other can't-confirm-either-way case above) whenever a proxy is
    configured for this URL's scheme and `host` isn't bypassed for it --
    never probes the PROXY host either, since a proxy's own TCP liveness
    says nothing about the upstream server this preflight exists to
