"""halo_harness.plugin_fetch -- W4a `--plugin-dir`/`--plugin-url`: "load a
plugin's skills, commands, agents, hooks and MCP servers from a directory or
a git URL" (plans/2.0.1-w4-plan.md W4a item 2). `--plugin-dir` needs no
fetching at all -- its path IS the plugin root, handed straight to
`config.agents_md.discover_agents`'s own `plugin_roots=` kwarg (the one
precedence tier that already exists for "a plugin" generally). `--plugin-url`
(a git URL, per the gap list's own gloss -- Claude Code's real flag fetches
a .zip; this harness takes the simpler, already-everywhere-available git
clone instead) is cloned ONCE per URL into a cache keyed by its own hash, so
a repeat launch with the same URL reuses the existing checkout rather than
re-cloning every single time.

W5 (carried from W4a): `resolve_plugin_roots`'s own output is now threaded
through ALL FIVE of Claude Code's plugin precedence tiers for a CLI-
supplied plugin directory/URL, not just agents -- `headless.build_session`
resolves it ONCE, near the top, and hands the same list to `discover_agents`
(`plugin_roots=`), `mcp_setup.build_manager` (`extra_plugin_roots=`, via
`config.plugins.discover_plugin_mcp_servers`'s own `extra_roots=`),
`build_hook_runner` (`extra_plugin_roots=`, via `hooks.load_plugin_hooks`),
and `commands.registry.Registry.discover` (`plugin_roots=`, which reaches
both `commands/custom.py`'s own `commands/` scan and `commands/skills.py`'s
own `skills/` scan) -- plus `Session.plugin_roots`/`ToolContext.
plugin_roots` so a model-invoked `Skill` tool call sees a CLI plugin's
skills too, not only the `/` slash-command surface. A CLI-supplied root has
no `installed_plugins.json` record to read a NAME from (unlike an installed
plugin, whose name is the manifest key) -- `plugin_name_for_root` below
reads `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`'s own `name` field, falling back to the
root directory's own basename, and that name is what every tier below uses:
MCP servers as `plugin_<name>_<server>` (`config.plugins.plugin_server_
name`, same as an installed plugin), skills/commands namespaced `<name>:
<skill-or-command>` (binary-facts sec.11: "plugin skills are
`<plugin>:<skill>`" -- commands follow the same convention)."""
