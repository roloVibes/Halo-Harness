"""halo_harness.redact -- the ONE shared secret redactor (2.0.1 W3a: "one
redactor shared with export_cli"). Moved here, out of `export_cli.py`,
which now just imports these same names back (so every existing `from
halo_harness.export_cli import sanitize_text/sanitize_node/_SECRET_ENV_
NAMES/...` keeps working unchanged) -- `halo_harness.bugreport` is the
other, newer caller, which also layers two bugreport-specific extras on
top via `redact_for_bugreport` below (a bugreport's surface -- env values,
config.json, routes.json, raw log lines -- is far wider than one session's
own JSONL, so it gets a stronger, best-effort-paranoid pass).

Best-effort redaction only (a convenience for safely sharing a transcript/
report, never a security boundary): well-known secret-shaped tokens, plus
NAME=value for a short list of well-known secret env var names as they'd
appear in a Bash `env`/`printenv` tool_result the model actually ran, OR
`"NAME": "value"` as they'd appear in a Read of settings.json's own `env`
block.
