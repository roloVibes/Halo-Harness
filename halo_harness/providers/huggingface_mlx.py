"""halo_harness.providers.huggingface_mlx -- Halo 2.0.3 round 5f: the
`hf:mlx/<org>/<repo>` route. Apple Silicon only, off by default, lazy
import (nothing here is imported unless an `hf:mlx/*` ref is actually
parsed/resolved -- a box with no `mlx-lm` installed, or not even a Mac, is
completely untouched). Builds on round 5c's managed-server primitives
(`providers.local_runtime.start_managed_server`/the `~/.halo/run/local-
servers.json` registry) UNCHANGED: `mlx_lm_server_argv` already takes
`model_path` as a bare string and does `str(model_path)`, so passing a Hub
repo id (never a real path) works today with no change to that module --
`mlx_lm.server --model <repo_id>` is exactly how mlx-lm's own README says
to point it at a Hub repo (it downloads/reuses the Hub cache on first use,
GPU-RESEARCH.md section 7).

Design: `plans/2.0.3-ollama-round2-brief.md` "Round 5f",
`docs/harness/GPU-RESEARCH.md` section 7 and the Apple memory-share rule.
