"""halo_harness.providers.ollama_calibrate -- Halo 2.0.3 round 5b item 1/2:
"fit calibration from Ollama's own telemetry, no GPU tool required."
`halo ollama calibrate <model> [--host NAME] [--start N]` (and the same
procedure run automatically the first time a model is used on a host with
no learned cap) loads a model at a candidate `num_ctx`, reads `/api/ps`
back (`size` vs `size_vram`), and steps down by powers of two until the
model is FULLY resident -- a measured fact, never a GPU-memory guess.
Results persist in `~/.halo/ollama-fit.json` (state dir), mirroring
`providers.ollama_capability`'s own cache-file pattern (atomic tmp+replace
write, `{}`/missing-file degrades to empty rather than raising).

A learned cap never expires on its own (brief item 2) -- it is re-measured
only by an explicit `halo ollama calibrate` or when the model's own
`digest` changes (a different `ollama pull`) or `ollama_version` changes
(a server upgrade may change how memory is actually used); `lookup_
learned_cap` treats either mismatch as "no learned cap at all" rather
than trusting a stale measurement. The SAME file also keeps the last real
turn's throughput numbers per (host, model) -- brief item 7, `halo ollama`
prints them -- since both are small, rarely-written, host+model-keyed
facts about one Ollama installation; no reason for a second file.

    (the common case on a roomy card) used to be recorded as-is even when

    the true ceiling
    instead of settling for the first lucky guess. Bounded by `min(

    stepped down the same way, and reaching the floor with nothing ever
    measured reported `does_not_fit`, a verdict `run_auto_calibration`
