"""halo_harness.providers.profiles -- per-provider/model compatibility
profiles (H1 scope A). The report's central finding is that a gateway's
behaviour cannot be guessed from its base URL alone ("for an endpoint it
does not recognize the detection answers as though it were OpenAI itself,
which is wrong for most OpenAI-compatible gateways") -- so every request
this harness builds is driven by an explicit `ProviderProfile`, resolved
from (host, model family) with per-model overrides from `model_table.json`
(an Aider-shaped data file, not code).

H2 must-do 2: `model_table.json` is now the COMPILED form of the canonical
`reports/Open weight model adapter rules.md` block (`tools/
ingest_model_table.py` -- 64 model rows, effective row = family (+) model
(+) host, `unverified` flags carried through per row) -- every field a
tabled row can supply (sampling, reasoning replay/effort, tool_choice
modes, tool id format, leak patterns, Databricks rate limits, ...) is read
from THAT row; `_fallback_family_defaults` below (the old
`_thinking_defaults_for_family`) now only fires for the handful of
proprietary families the open-weight report doesn't cover (claude/gpt/
gemini/generic), exactly the narrow role its name now says.

This module is purely additive: nothing in `bridge.py`'s proxy path imports
it, so the 97 proxy tests are unaffected regardless of what's seeded here.
