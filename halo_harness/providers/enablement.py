"""halo_harness.providers.enablement -- H15 item 21, REPLACED by the H15
part 2 addendum (rolo, live use on his personal Mac, same day): detected
credentials/a real claude.ai login now AUTO-enable a provider -- the
"never run init, the harness already finds the available keys and
subscription and uses those" case. The `"providers"` block in config.json
stores OVERRIDES only: an explicit `"enabled"` key (true OR false) always
wins over auto-detection; a provider the block doesn't mention at all (or
no block yet) falls through to `credentials_present` (the exact same
detection `/model`'s own hint text and `/providers`/`halo providers`
already compute).

Exact per-provider detection rule (`credentials_present` below):
OpenRouter/Anthropic API (key)/TypeSafe are auto-enabled once their key is
found (env file, shell env, settings env chain); Databricks once a host
AND token are found (same sources, plus `~/.databrickscfg`); Claude Code
subscription (`cc:`) ONLY when `claude auth status` reports `loggedIn` with
`authMethod` exactly `"claude.ai"` -- a `claude` driven by an API token or
a custom base URL (a work box's own settings-driven login) never auto-
enables it, loggedIn or not.

Stored at `~/.halo/config.json`'s own `"providers"` key:
`{"<name>": {"enabled": bool, ...non-secret settings}}` -- secrets stay in
the env file, exactly like every other provider credential this harness
has ever stored; this module never reads/writes a key or token. Migration
(`ensure_providers_migrated`) is now a permanent no-op: auto-detection
already covers what it used to write once, live, every time, so there is
nothing left for a one-time migration to do.
