"""halo_harness.providers.stream -- the request-orchestration lift (H0,
plan section D2). This module is the library form of what used to live
inline in bridge.py's Handler._handle_messages_post/_handle_upstream_stream/
_reader_thread: given an Anthropic-shaped request body plus a resolved
Route/profile/credentials, it does the one-fixable-overflow-clamp-retry
dance against the openai-chat dialect (OpenRouter or Databricks-chat), then
yields the Anthropic SSE events for the reply as plain dicts.

2.0.1 finding 18: a genuine CONNECT-phase failure (DNS/TCP/TLS/our own
bounded-connect timeout -- `providers.http.is_connect_failure_message`)
is never retried here any more -- a retry cannot help DNS, and the
documented 8s connect budget (`providers.http.DEFAULT_CONNECT_TIMEOUT_S`)
is now really just 8s, not up to 16s. The one silent retry THIS module
still does is for a POST-connect failure (a dropped keep-alive/mid-
response RST -- `format_post_connect_error`, no CONNECT_FAILURE_MARKER):
that one genuinely can recover on an immediate re-dial.

Two phases, exactly like the design doc:
  * phase 1 (nothing yielded yet): translate the body, apply the profile/
    cached-max_tokens clamp, make the upstream call with retries. Raises
    before the first `yield` on failure -- callers drive this with
    ``next(gen)`` so a 4xx/5xx never gets a 200 already written to the wire.
  * phase 2: yields ``message_start`` first, then the translated Anthropic
    events as they arrive, and ``{"type": "ping"}`` after `req.ping_interval`
    seconds of upstream silence. Passing ``abort`` (a ``threading.Event``)
    lets a caller interrupt a live stream -- checked every
    ``min(ping_interval, 0.25)`` seconds so it reacts within ~250ms.

The Databricks Claude PASSTHROUGH dialect (raw Anthropic-to-Anthropic relay)
deliberately does NOT go through this module -- see providers/anthropic_sse.py
and routing.build_passthrough_body/build_passthrough_headers instead; the
proxy's own Handler._handle_passthrough_stream is unchanged.
