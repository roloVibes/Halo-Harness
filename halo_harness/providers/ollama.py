"""halo_harness.providers.ollama -- Halo 2.0.3 round 2: host config, the
native-API GET probes (`/api/version`, `/api/tags`, `/api/show`, `/api/ps`),
the per-host catalog cache, and the context-ownership rule for the `ol:`
provider. The native `/api/chat` request builder lives in
`providers.ollama_request`; the NDJSON streaming decoder lives in
`providers.ollama_stream` -- split the same way `databricks.py`/`dbx_routing.py`
and `oai_stream.py`/`stream.py` already are, so no one file grows past the
250-line-per-write house habit while it's being built.

Design per `plans/2.0.3-ollama-round2-brief.md` "Round 2" and
`docs/harness/LOCAL-MODELS-RESEARCH.md` sections 1/2/4/7: one dialect
("ollama") reaches a local daemon, a named LAN host, or Ollama Cloud, all
through the SAME native `/api/chat` wire shape -- only `base_url` and
(cloud-only) an `Authorization: Bearer <api_key>` header differ (research
doc Q7). Every host is addressed by name (`ol:<model>@<hostname>`); never a
literal LAN address in this file or in any test/doc (`tests/
test_privacy_scan.py`).

# loaded still sends SOME `options.num_ctx` rather than inventing a number

# 10.2k prompt tokens", built-in tool definitions plus the system prompt,
# before the user says anything) -- every fallback-path request therefore
# overflowed on its FIRST attempt, every single time, forcing the retry
# in `providers.stream` to fire unconditionally. 16384 comfortably covers
# that measured floor with room for an actual reply; shrinking the prompt

    the number-only wrapper every pre-5b caller keeps using unchanged.

    Every candidate that's actually known is a SIMULTANEOUS entry in one
    `min(...)` -- never an elif-style override chain where a bigger
    `host_max_ctx`/`learned_cap` could win over a SMALLER live
    `fit_estimate` (that would risk the exact overload this whole round
    exists to prevent):

    - Review fix pass (finding 6): `learned_cap` (`halo ollama
      calibrate`'s own measured ground truth) used to REPLACE
      `fit_estimate` entirely once known -- a stale cap measured on an

      media transcoder) later held some of that VRAM, loading the
      session partially offloaded. `learned_cap` and `fit_estimate` are
      now BOTH independent candidates in the same `min(...)` whenever
      `fit_estimate` is a real positive int -- whichever is actually
      smaller right now wins, exactly the "never lets a bigger ... win
      over a SMALLER live fit_estimate" rule this docstring already
      claimed (the one that LOSES here is the OLDER "REPLACES... a
      measured fact always outranks a computed guess" claim just above
      it, which this fix removes: it was never true against a smaller
      live reading and the code didn't match it either). `fit_estimate
      is WEIGHTS_DO_NOT_FIT` still contributes nothing numeric (it is
      not a positive int) -- there is no live reading to compare the cap
      against in that case, so the measured cap is free to stand alone.
    - A REMOTE host (`remote=True`) with NOTHING ELSE known at all (no
      `host_max_ctx`, no usable fit/learned-cap candidate, no recorded
      does-not-fit) gets `remote_unknown_ceiling` (32768) as an EXTRA
      candidate alongside `hard_cap` (131072) -- never REPLACING
      `hard_cap` (`min` picks the smaller 32768 regardless), so an
      operator who sets `host_max_ctx` bigger than 32768 still gets
      exactly that, still never past 131072.
    - Review fix pass (finding 5): a LOCAL host with nothing known gets
      the SAME treatment, not the trained_context/hard_cap this used to
      silently fall through to -- "local" was never a reason to assume a
      usable OS GPU-memory reading exists (a CPU-only box, a VM, AMD on
      Windows with no rocm-smi, Intel, Linux AMD via sysfs all read as
      "nothing known" here too). `cpu_only=True` (the caller positively
      knows this box has no GPU at all, not just "couldn't read" one)
      tightens that local default to 8192 instead of 32768 -- a CPU-only
      box pays for KV cache out of system RAM, not a GPU's own budget.
    - Review fix pass (finding 5): `recorded_does_not_fit=True` (a prior
      `halo ollama calibrate`/auto-calibration attempt measured this
      model does NOT fit even at the calibration floor, recorded on
      disk) is treated exactly like a live `WEIGHTS_DO_NOT_FIT` reading
      -- `fallback_when_unknown` joins the pool instead of the model a
      measurement already proved doesn't fit getting the largest window
      available. Like the live sentinel, a `learned_cap` (proof it DOES
      fit at some size) still overrides a stale does-not-fit record.

    `fit_estimate` is one of three things: a positive int (an ordinary
    candidate), `None` (genuinely unknown -- simply skipped), or
    `providers.ollama_fit.WEIGHTS_DO_NOT_FIT` (round 3 fix pass: a model
    whose own WEIGHTS don't fit in free memory -- `fallback_when_unknown`
    joins the pool instead of the hard cap being left to win, UNLESS
    `learned_cap` is also known, in which case the measured ground truth
    that it DOES fit at some size wins outright and the fallback is never

    staying at `remote_unknown_ceiling` (32768), a weights-do-not-fit

    never license a number the initial decision itself would have

    retry within this ceiling, from the server's own reported prompt
    size -- see that function's own docstring for why a retry can still
