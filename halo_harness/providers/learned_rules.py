"""halo_harness.providers.learned_rules -- the LEARNED per-endpoint
`reasoning_effort_with_tools` rule (1.0.1 part 2, item 22 remainder): when a
live 400 proves a Databricks endpoint with no `model_table.json` row of its
own ALSO rejects `reasoning_effort` alongside tools (the same shape the
gpt-6 table rows already document), the harness remembers "none" for that
exact endpoint -- in `Session.provider_profile` for the REST OF THIS
SESSION (so every later step sends it correctly the first time, never
paying for the failing request again), and in this per-endpoint cache on
disk so a FUTURE session against the same endpoint never has to re-learn
it live either.

Persisted at `<state_dir>/learned-rules.json`:
`{"<provider>:<model>": {"reasoning_effort_with_tools": "none"}}`. A
`model_table.json` row (including an explicit `null` override there)
always wins over this cache -- learning only ever fills a gap the static
table hasn't been updated for yet, it never overrides a verified row (see
`providers.profiles.resolve_profile`'s own `row.get(..., learned)` order).
