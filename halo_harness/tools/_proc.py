    `exit_code` is None only when the process itself could never be
    launched (`merged_output` is then a plain error message, not real
    subprocess output), OR when a timeout was handed off (see below) --
    the process is still running, ownership just moved elsewhere. `abort`
    is a threading.Event polled alongside the timeout; either firing kills
    the whole process group, never just the immediate child.

    Halo 2.0.7 round 0c: `steer_cut` is a SEPARATE, softer early-exit
    signal -- the harness sets it the instant a user steer is queued while
    this command runs, so the turn can reach its steer safe point without
    waiting out a long command. When it fires AND `on_steer_handoff` is
    given, the still-live `(proc, q, collector)` are handed off with the
    SAME clean single-writer contract as a timeout handoff (the caller --
    agent.jobs.JobRegistry -- takes over draining and owns the process;
    nothing is killed), and the tuple returns `aborted=True` with
    `exit_code=None` so the caller knows the wait ended early but the
    process lives on. Without a callback `steer_cut` is ignored entirely
    (the command runs to completion, the pre-0c behavior). A real `abort`
    always wins the race: it is checked FIRST, so an Esc arriving in the
    same poll tick as the steer still kills the process group.

    finding 7: completion is keyed on the PROCESS exiting (`proc.poll()`),
    never on stdout EOF -- a backgrounded child (`sleep 100 &`) keeps the
    pipe's write end open long after the wrapper shell itself has exited,
    so waiting for EOF blocks for the full timeout even though the
    foreground command finished immediately. Once the process has exited,
    only a short bounded drain (`_DRAIN_AFTER_EXIT_S`) collects whatever
    was already flushed to the pipe before returning -- the process group
    is never killed just because it happened to leave a background job
    running.

    H8 scope A (dsh's agent-loop README, quoted in H8-brief.md): "a
    foreground command that hits its timeout is moved to the background
    rather than killed" -- when `on_timeout_handoff` is given AND a real
    TIMEOUT (never an abort) is what ends the wait, it is called with the
    still-live `(proc, q, collector)` instead of killing anything, and this
    function returns immediately WITHOUT touching any of the three again
    (a clean single-writer handoff: the caller, agent.jobs.JobRegistry,
    takes over draining `q` into `collector` and owns `proc` from that
    point on). `timed_out` is still True in the returned tuple so a caller
    that passed no callback keeps seeing today's exact behaviour."""
