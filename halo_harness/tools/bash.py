    "`timeout` (milliseconds) for a longer wait, up to a maximum of 600000ms (10 minutes).\n"
    "- Output is stdout and stderr merged together, in the order produced; very long output is "
    "truncated with a pointer to the full text.\n"
    "- Avoid using this tool to run find, grep, cat, head, tail, ls, or sed, unless explicitly "
    "instructed or after you have verified that a dedicated tool (Glob, Grep, Read, Edit) cannot "
    "accomplish your task.\n"
    "- The working directory persists across calls within one session: a `cd` in one command is "
    "still in effect for the next one. Try to maintain your current working directory throughout "
    "the session by using absolute paths and avoiding usage of `cd`, unless the user explicitly "
    "requests it.\n"
    "- Always quote file paths that contain spaces (e.g. cd \"path with spaces/file.txt\").\n"
    "- Chain related commands with `&&` or `;` rather than making several separate tool calls.\n"
    "- Set `run_in_background=true` for a command expected to run for a while (a server, a watch/build "
    "loop, a long download); you get back a shell_id immediately and the command keeps running. Use "
    "the BashOutput tool to check on it (returns only the output produced since the last check) and "
    "TaskStop to stop it early. A command that runs in the FOREGROUND and hits its own timeout is "
    "moved to the background automatically instead of being killed -- check it the same way."

# single plain command (after optional leading env-VAR=VALUE assignments),
