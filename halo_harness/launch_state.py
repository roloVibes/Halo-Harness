"""halo_harness.launch_state -- 2.0.1 W3a: "launch with the last session's
model and effort" (a user report, live: "have the last session's model
choice and effort start every time you launch it, it defers back to
deepseek each time"). Persists the last `/model`/`/effort` choice to
`~/.halo/state.json` (tmp + os.replace, same convention as `providers.
databricks._atomic_write_json`) -- NEVER to Claude Code's own files. Two
scopes are kept per field:
`global` (the most recent choice made ANYWHERE) and `by_cwd` (keyed by a
normalized cwd string) -- `resolve_*`'s own `memory` parameter picks
cwd-then-global (the default) or global-only, matching the new
`model_memory` config key (`"cwd"`|`"global"`, default `"cwd"`).

This module only ever reads/writes `state.json` -- it knows nothing about
provider enablement or model parsing; `headless.build_session`'s own
precedence chain (flags > last_model/last_effort > config.json > settings.
json > provider default) is responsible for validating a persisted ref
still resolves (a provider disabled since it was saved falls through with
one notice) before ever using it.
