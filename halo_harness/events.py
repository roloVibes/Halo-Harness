"""halo_harness.events -- the authoritative event/command contract between the
agent loop (halo_harness.agent.loop.Session) and any UI. Print mode (H0) reads
these directly; the Textual TUI (U2+) will too. This module is pure data --
zero dependencies on the rest of the package -- so every layer can import it
without risking a cycle.

See the plan's D3 ("Message + event model") and D-Contract ("core <-> UI
reconciliation", which is authoritative where it adds to D3 -- the `status`
shape, `replay`, `notification`, and `parent_tool_use_id` on subagent events
all come from there). H0's own loop (no tools yet) only ever emits a subset
of these kinds (user_message, message_start, text_delta, thinking_delta,
message_end, status, error, turn_done) -- the rest of the vocabulary exists
now so H1+ milestones can start emitting them without changing this module's
contract shape.
