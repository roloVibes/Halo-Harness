"""halo_harness.shadow -- git-shadow snapshots for `/rewind` (U5 scope B).

Every Write/Edit/Bash-that-changed-files step records the RESULTING content
of every file it touched into a real, isolated git repository under
`~/.halo/sessions/<slug>/<session_id>/shadow/` (mirroring OpenCode's
own snapshot mechanism and Claude Code's `file-history`), keyed as one git
commit per step. `/rewind <step>` (aliases `/undo` steps back, `/redo`
steps forward) restores the REAL working tree to that step: every file ever
tracked is checked out from that step's commit and written back to its real
location -- a full "restore the working tree to a step", not a per-file
diff/patch.

A real absolute path (Windows drive letters included) is "mangled" into a
safe, collision-free relative path inside the shadow repo (`_mangle`/
`_unmangle`) so the SAME shadow repo can track files from anywhere the
session touched, not just one subtree.

Deliberate scope cut (documented, not a bug): rewinding restores the
CONTENT of every file tracked as of the target step; it does not delete a
file that was created by a LATER step (that file simply isn't in the
target commit's tree, so it's left alone). A full create/delete-aware
rewind is future work -- OpenCode's own `revert` has the same "flags then
cleans up on the next prompt" asymmetry rather than a true transactional
undo.

    cut): a path that was ALREADY dirty before the command ran is excluded
    either way (same key in both dicts), the one residual limitation this
    bounded before/after diff still carries (it cannot tell a file that was
    modified, then modified AGAIN by this command, from one left alone --
    both show the same status code on both sides)."""

    via a `run_worker(..., thread=True)`) is responsible for keeping this
    off the UI thread, exactly like `_git_branch`'s own subprocess call.

    Returns the set of absolute paths `git status --porcelain=v1` reports
    as untracked ('??') right now, or `None` when `cwd` isn't a git repo,
    `git` itself isn't reachable, or the call times out -- the documented
    limit for a non-git directory (no shadow-copy for Bash there at all).

    parse shared with the tracked-modified case below) -- the public
    contract here (a bare set of untracked-only paths, `None` outside a
